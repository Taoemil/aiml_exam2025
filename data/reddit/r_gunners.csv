mqsqh6g,You make a solid point. Some players just become scapegoats. But we need to look at what they're actually saying to properly judge if there's substance to what they're saying. Him being selfish and not passing are things that could be potential issues especially in our team. They also say he's raw so there's potential for improvement.    There's a chance under a new coach that he could curb those bad habits. But Martinelli has issues keeping his head up at times. He's gotten a bit better at it but it's still there. There's a chance Gittens won't be able to fix his own issues. He's a risk and an expensive one at that.  If Arteta can get rid of his bad habits we've got a potential 100m player. But if he can't then we're in trouble especially for the price BVB are quoting.   I trust the recruitment but it's crunch time now.

mqrqld6,"Arsenal should try to stifle PSG's rhythm, and I think that the best way to achieve that is to make the game be as scrappy as possible. A game that flows well favors PSG, as they can keep the ball for long periods of time and toy with you. A stop-start game prevents them from putting constant pressure and movement to try to break you down. How can Arsenal make the game scrappy? By making and forcing many fouls. Also by trying to make PSG fight for aerial duels, which is something that bothered PSG in the first leg. It felt that PSG was great at winning all but the aerial duels, and it felt that they became a lot more common as the game went on, breaking PSG's rhythm and allowing Arsenal to get control. Good pressing is also important. The more they have to hoof it long, the more we have of those aerial duels they struggle to win at, and the harder it becomes for them to get into their ideal rhythm. Arsenal should try its hardest to not let PSG get into the flow we saw from them in the matches against Liverpool and Villa in Paris, when the opposition could almost never break out of their own half, it was a pain to make even three passes in a row.  I don't think this is just the best strategy to deal with PSG, I think it's the best way to have a good chance against highly technical teams that put heavy emphasis on ball possession. Mourinho did this against Guardiola's Barcelona in the final of the 2011 Copa Del Rey, spoiling the treble for the best version of that Barcelona, even better than the one that actually won the treble in 2009.

mqrm665,"I read more about Gittens. Seems like Dortmund fans have concerns about his consistency. I mean, at 20 no one should be surprised that there are such issues unless you're a world class talent.   Although one thing that Gittens constantly provides is great dribbling. This season he is among the 10 players who completed most dribbles in Top 5 European leagues.  Btw also besides Doku, Gittens has played the least minutes so his per 90 numbers are even more promising:  Source: https://www.statmuse.com/fc/ask/most-dribbles-completed-this-season-europe-top-5-league  Imo, Arteta is looking for his own Doku, what I mean by that is Arteta wants a LW that can consistently beat his man in a low block, because that inevitably opens up space for others. Williams links confirm that in my eyes too, although he would be a very costly solution.   One the reasons for that is  we keep dropping points to teams that defend deep, because they know that besides Saka we don't have a player that can take a ball, beat defenders and force other defenders to commit. Martinelli lost that respect in the last 2 seasons, he still provides in other ways, but the failures to beat a low/middle block persist.",1746476020.0,boatinavolcano,gunners,t3_1kf65lb,t3_1kf65lb,6,/r/Gunners/comments/1kf65lb/may_05_2025_daily_discussion_transfers_thread/mqrm665/

mqr6ojz,"1 - We do have more than one creator in the team. Rice and Saka are both huge creators within the side, alongside Odegaard. The ""Odegaard is the only creator in the team"" narrative is only used by those who want to blame everything on Odegaard.  2 - Martinelli had a drop off last season, this season he has been better. But even in his current state, he is better than most LW wingers that people want us to sign. Martinelli may be weaker going forward than these LW players that people want, but he's miles better than all of them when it comes to working his bollocks off when we defend as a unit. Love it or hate it, but Arteta wants his wingers to drop back and defend as well as provide going forward.   3 - Yes. Although, I can only assume you are speaking from a ""Saliba has ambition to win things and will want to leave to go to Real Madrid"" if your other two questions are anything to go by. Saliba does have ambition to win things. Saka does too. Both have said that they want to win things at Arsenal.

mqr181n,"Anyone we buy uses up transfer funds.   There's so much emotion in the arguments in this sub. People simply are not looking at things logically. Let's examine your position:  Is Isak realistic? Newcastle are probably thinking they could finish *above* us this season. Even if we win CL, it would be tough to tempt him into leaving, let alone get the club to sell since they're not short of cash and have a solid project themselves.  I don't know why everyone is so married to that pipe dream? You're making it sound like it's us who are choosing to not sign the player. And if it happens, we'd be smashing the transfer record by a lot to get him.  Aside from Isak, what other elite striker exists out there that would warrant a big money move? All the other targets being thrown around here are massive gambles in their own right: **Sesko**, **Gyokeres**. **Osimhen**, maybe, but he's not even in any conversations these days.  As for prem-ready players. It's unlikely we buy **Ollie Watkins**, and **Cunha** seems to be going elsewhere (or we're not interested). Who's left? **Semenyo**? **Mateta**? **Mbuemo** (not a striker, but let's go with it). That's it for PL-proven strikers that would be a realistic targets.   Which of those gets you excited? If Isak is your dream, then I'm sure you'd be underwhelmed with the alternatives.  That said, personally, I'd take any 2 of Cunha, Mateta and Mbuemo. 100-120 would do it and they could cover multiple spots along the front 3. I'd be happy with those signings, but I'd never bet on them happening.  The market for quality attackers is thin. For strikers it's next to nothing. There's just none: Madrid doesn't really have one (Mbappe is Mbappe, though). Barcelona is fielding a geriatric (who was having one of his best seasons, notwithstanding); Munich paid €100m for a 30yo Harry Kane just to win the Bundesliga... which they usually win anyway. PSG doesn't have an actual striker. Even AC Milan had Olivier Giroud starting for them as recently as last season. If I was a Manchester United fan who saw Cantona, Cole + Yorke, van Nistelrooy, Rooney, Ronaldo and van Persie play, I'd be weeping at what I'm having to watch these days. And they've always been able to make big money purchases.  I was a football fan at a time when all of the above teams had Ballon d'or, CL and WC winners starting for them within the same era. The current market is shit.  So, to get back to the point. Saying 100m for Rodrygo is too much is fine in isolation. But you cannot frame it as if there's all these elite strikers who are realistic targets just waiting to be bought, and we're not looking at them.",1746469830.0,chrisd1680,gunners,t3_1keekv3,t1_mqoz41t,1,/r/Gunners/comments/1keekv3/revelo_real_madrid_are_contemplating_the_sale_of/mqr181n/

The player staring down 2 years of not playing accepts a lucrative move to a Saudi club for way more money than we'd ever make from him in January.   3. We'd communicate a FAFO policy clear enough for Real to pull their finger out and actually negotiate a purchase come January or lose the player.   Madrid isn't going to wait 2 years to sign a benchwarmer on a free. Saliba isn't going to wait 2 years to fuck Arsenal over if Madrid has moved on. We communicate clearly to the rest of the squad and their agents what the consequences of trying to fuck over the club for selfish interests is.   Most importantly...put the lucrative contract befitting of the highest value CB in world football in front of him and show him he is appreciated. He signs it, he's shown his commitment to the squad and we can build around it.

mqqoprc,"Havertz isn't a passenger - in general, but especially in those areas.  When he has a runner ahead of him, his key passing into the box from the RHS is unironically better than Odegaard's, both in terms of quality as well as variety.  Arsenal hasn't seen how outstanding he can be in those areas because Havertz a.) never has a CF ahead of him and b.) isn't usually in the RHS, especially with space + time to turn.  Because Havertz has almost always been our highest receiver, people assume he's a passenger because they see him passing back all the time - but that's not Havertz's fault, it's not like he can do anything else from those positions.  If we shifted mountains to get Havertz on the ball with his head up towards goal like we do for Odegaard, you'd have a very different perspective on the player.  I'm not saying we have to do that, I'm just explaining the contextual differences - you cannot assess players without first accounting for context.  You also have to consider that the deeper controlling stuff Odegaard does is going to be parasitized by Zubimendi anyway.
