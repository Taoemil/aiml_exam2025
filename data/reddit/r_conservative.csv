mqrixju,"In a piece for *Health Affairs*, Hoover Senior Fellow [Scott W. Atlas](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/scott-w-atlas) and coauthors, including National Institutes of Health director and emeritus senior fellow [Jay Bhattacharya](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/jay-bhattacharya), survey lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic regarding physician autonomy, public health messaging, and the importance of free speech. The authors argue that in the course of the pandemic, “Suppression of scientific debate and the marginalization of dissenting voices weakened public trust in medical institutions.” They note the importance of physician-scientists being able to express dissenting and alternative views on pressing medical questions, maintaining that “suppressing alternative perspectives can lead to flawed policies that are difficult to reverse.” They conclude with a call for social media companies to prioritize free speech and to avoid “the temptation to censor,” building on the foundational free society principle that “the public should be trusted to assess information.”",1746475077.0,HooverInstitution,conservative,t3_1kfl92t,t3_1kfl92t,3,/r/Conservative/comments/1kfl92t/physician_autonomy_and_free_speech_essential_for/mqrixju/

mqpqgc6,"Just over five years ago, I renewed my California driver's license using the state's DMV website. A question popped up about whether I wanted a Real ID or state ID. I chose the Real ID. I didn't receive any other instructions at all apart that I could print out the temporary ID and receipt.   So, I brought that to the local DMV (along with all necessary paperwork). I stood in the long lines (normal for California) and waited four hours to speak with the DMV rep -- only to be told that their ""system isn't ready yet."" They said that their system wouldn't even recognize that I chose a ""Real ID"" (despite my receipt and paperwork) because there were ""issues"" in the system. They advised me to make an appointment for a Real ID and return another day.  Prior to my last birthday, I needed to renew my license again. Again, I selected the ""Real ID."" I was given an appointment date and instructions of what to bring. I showed up to the appointment (which still requires a wait time of a couple of hours in the Bay Area/Silicon Valley DMVs). However, this time, they stated that I had waited too long to bring in my paperwork.   I told them that I only selected the first available appointment during checkout (via the DMV website). The DMV worker said, ""Oh. Yeah, it's not a good website."" He then said that their system wasn't working properly. He advised me to make another appointment over the phone or at the desk (which would require waiting in line for two hours to them be sent to the appropriate counter). So, I left. I was mailed the non-Real ID.   Now, I will have to go through this hassle and pay for another license and hope for the best.   A Real ID shouldn't be so difficult to obtain. I suppose that it isn't so problematic in most states as it is in California -- particularly areas like the Silicon Valley.

mqp7wqh,"I am old enough to have witnessed firsthand a major shift in the health of Americans.  As a child in the 70's, obese children were rare.  Obese adults were also less common.   Diabetes was called Juvenile (Type I) and Adult Onset (Type II).   Type II, which is typically caused by diet, was unheard of in children.   When kids started getting fat, and getting ""Adult Onset Diabetes"", they had to stop calling it that.  The culprits, in my opinion:    1 - the reliance on process foods, which are convenient, highly palatable, yet deliver very little nutrition.  2 - the rapid increase in sugar consumption, largely driven by the FDA guidelines of ""low fat, no fat"" for health in the late 70's, early 80's.  Manufacturers took out fat, and replaced it with sugar (usually HFCS) to help maintain flavor and shelf life.  That's how we ended up with sugary breads and fat free yogurts with 18 grams of sugar.  We have to reverse this.  It's costing us trillions in healthcare costs, and it's literally killing people.  (Insert here my rant about giving children in public school chocolate milk every day.
