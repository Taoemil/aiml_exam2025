mqud3ox,"> It is possible that Mr. Trump had “Escape From Alcatraz” on his mind when he declared on social media on Sunday that he had directed federal agencies to rebuild and reopen Alcatraz to serve as “a symbol of Law, Order, and JUSTICE.”  > When he was asked on Monday how he came up with the idea, he said that he should have been a “moviemaker,” and he praised the island’s top-notch security.  > “Nobody ever escaped,” he said, not quite accurately. “One person almost got there, but they — as you know the story — they found his clothing rather badly ripped up. It was a lot of shark bites, a lot of problems.”  > In “Escape From Alcatraz,” shreds of the material of a raincoat are found floating in the bay.  The idiot watched a movie and let it inform his policy decisions... What a fucking clown.  But let's also not pretend like he isn't trying to follow in Bukele's footsteps here. Even though this type of project would be extremely costly, impractical, inhumane, and would amount to a massive logistical nightmare, this is just another attempt from Trump to appeal to his seething and mindless followers with more ""law and order,"" ""tough on crime"" dog whistling.  Alcatraz was abandoned for a reason. It's literally a ruin at this point. They've actually had to reinforce areas of the prison to prevent concrete from falling on the heads of tourists.  Its buildings are missing roofs and entire walls, there's no sewage system or running water, and the government pronounced it a crumbling ""relic"" over 60 years ago when they closed it down.  Alcatraz was also deemed insolvent, costly and ""insufficient"" to house prisoners. Rebuilding and maintaining it is just impractical from a mere economic perspective.  But now Trump wants to restore this relic because he watched a movie recently and he's more interested in rallying his base into a frenzy over more promises of ""crime and punishment"" and imprisoning ""undesirables.""  In all likelihood, Trump won't be able to follow through on yet another absurd proposal, but that hasn't stopped his supporters from demanding that Trump's political opponents be the first to grace its cells.  I bet Trump's also thinking that he can use Alcatraz as a Bukele-like ""terrorist containment center"" where he can incarcerate so-called migrant ""gang members"" and ""criminals,"" as well as foreign students, protestors, journalists and political dissidents with little to no due process.

mqu0mk4,"(excerpts from article)   The House Judiciary Committee’s portion of major spending legislation includes a provision that appears to limit the authority of judges to find U.S. government officials in contempt of court, drawing fire from critics who say it amounts to freeing the Trump administration to ignore court orders  The measure, Section 70303, is the final paragraph of 116 pages of text the committee approved last week as part of the process detailed in the fiscal 2025 budget resolution.  The language would prohibit courts from using federal funds to enforce a contempt citation for failing to comply with court orders if plaintiffs don’t offer money for bond pursuant to the rules of civil procedure — something experts said does not happen in most cases challenging U.S. government policies.  A House Judiciary Committee aide said the provision is meant “basically to stop frivolous lawsuits.”  Democrats say the language would have a profound impact on the authority of the courts at a time when the Trump administration has expressed hostility towards judges for issuing orders against his policy initiatives.  At least two federal judges — Judge James E. Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and Judge Paula Xinis of the U.S. District Court of Maryland — have suggested they might find Trump administration officials in contempt of court in immigration-related cases.  At the markup of the text last Wednesday, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, top Democrat on the committee, said the proposal “seeks to strip the courts of their power to hold an administration in contempt when the president violates explicit judicial court orders.”",1746505967.0,Nerd-19958,politics,t3_1kfw11q,t3_1kfw11q,1,/r/politics/comments/1kfw11q/gop_aims_at_contempt_of_court_in_house/mqu0mk4/

mqtx2xz,"As per [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/cory-mills-florida-bronze-star-iraq-b2745118.html) 📰:  - Representative Cory Mills earned his Bronze Star for reportedly saving his fellow soldiers in Iraq, but those present say they don’t remember the lawmaker being there.   Representative Cory Mills, a MAGA Republican from Florida, was awarded a Bronze Star for his heroism in Iraq in 2003 — but those he allegedly saved don’t remember him being there, a new report reveals.  Mills was honored after he administered “life-saving care” to fellow soldiers Joe Heit and Alan Babin at “great risk to his own life” while under “intense enemy fire” in Iraq, NOTUS reports, citing the document recommending Mills receive the award. Mills enlisted in the Army in July 1999 at 19 years old and was honorably discharged in August 2003.  But Heit told NOTUS that Mills “didn’t save” his life, and that he didn’t even suffer life-threatening injuries.  “I don’t recall him being there either,” he added.  Henry Barbe, a medic who flew in via helicopter to help evacuate Babin, also told NOTUS he doesn’t remember Mills being there.  “From what I understand about Mills is he might have been in the unit. I don’t remember him being involved in the medevac,” Barbe said. “To be fair, I was worried about the patients. I don’t remember him, and from what I understand, other people don’t remember him.”  Chris Painter, the platoon sergeant, said he can “pretty much confirm 100% Cory Mills was not up at the bridges at the location of everything.”  “Now, if he came to the company position to assist in escorting Babin to the BN aid station, I don’t know...but he wasn’t at the bridge [where] it all happened I do know that,” Painter told NOTUS.  Army documents recommending Mills for the award also state he saved Joe Ferrand, a sergeant who had been “grabbed by an enemy insurgent” in a separate incident, according to NOTUS. But Ferrand previously claimed Mills’ involvement in the incident was a “fabrication” and said that the act “never took place,” in a written statement to government officials.  In response to these claims, Mills told NOTUS that “no soldier writes their own DA Form 638,” referring to the document used to recommend soldiers for awards.  “It is a recommendation for award and soldiers cannot recommend themselves,” Mills said. “The form must be reviewed and signed by commanding officers.”  Mills also conceded that it was “true” that Heit “did not have life-threatening injuries” and attributed the discrepancies to how chaotic the day was.  “I was on the ground,” Mills said. “It was a chaotic day and understandable that others may have different recollections of events.”  The questions around his Bronze Star have been relayed to the Office of Congressional Ethics, Department of Justice, a U.S. attorney’s office in Florida and the FBI, the source told NOTUS.  This isn’t the first time Mills’s military accomplishments have been questioned.  Last year, Mills’s Republican challenger Michael Johnson handed out flyers accusing him of lying about his military service and committing stolen valor, The Daytona Beach News-Journal reports. Mills denied the claims at the time.  “I’m tired of the slander and the defamation,” Mills told the News-Journal. “I ran for office to be able to serve the American people, not to defend something I did 20 years ago over and over and over.”  Mills was elected to Congress in 2022 and has since proven a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump. Mills even attended his hush money trial last summer alongside fellow lawmakers including Speaker of the House Mike Johnson and Representative Byron Donalds.  The Republican lawmaker also made headlines February after his romantic partner Sarah Raviani filed a police report claiming she had been assaulted by Mills at his Washington, D.C. apartment.  “(Her significant other for over a year) grabbed her, shoved her, and pushed her out of the door,” the police report obtained by NBC Washington states.  Raviani, a cofounder of the group Iranians for Trump, then allowed police to listen in on a phone call between her and the congressman in which he allegedly instructed her to “lie about the origin of her bruises.”  Mills “vehemently denies any wrongdoing whatsoever.”  The Independent has contacted Mills’s office for comment.",1746504402.0,T_Shurt,politics,t3_1kfvlfm,t3_1kfvlfm,1,/r/politics/comments/1kfvlfm/gop_rep_was_awarded_a_bronze_star_for_his_bravery/mqtx2xz/

mqtyyiy,"Per chatgpt:  Reestablishing Alcatraz Island as a modern supermax prison for 500 inmates would be a massive and logistically complex project. Here's a rough cost estimate broken into major components:   ---  1. Demolition of Existing Structures  Full teardown of the deteriorated historic prison and other non-salvageable facilities (environmentally sensitive process due to protected status): $100–150 million (Includes asbestos abatement, environmental protections, and work by marine contractors.)    ---  2. Island Stabilization and Infrastructure Upgrades  Foundation work, erosion control, island stabilization: $75–100 million  Utility infrastructure (power, water desalination, wastewater treatment, HVAC, and fire suppression): $150–200 million    ---  3. Construction of Modern Supermax Facility  500-inmate supermax prison built to ADX Florence standards (~$700K–$1M per bed, higher due to remote location): $350–500 million  Includes security tech, isolation cells, reinforced structures, air/water filtration, etc.    ---  4. Transportation Infrastructure (Off-Island and Marine)  Dedicated ferry system and dock improvements, emergency evacuation infrastructure, maintenance barge systems: $75–100 million    ---  5. Staff Housing and Support Facilities (On or Near Island)  If housing is built on the island (likely necessary for 24/7 staffing): $100–150 million (Housing, commissary, clinic, recreation for ~300–400 staff.)    ---  6. Security and Communications Infrastructure  Encrypted comms, surveillance, maritime radar perimeter, drone defense, etc.: $50–75 million    ---  7. Permitting, Environmental Compliance, Legal, and Public Engagement  Alcatraz is a National Historic Landmark and part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, requiring extensive NEPA, NHPA, and California Coastal Commission compliance: $50–100 million    ---  8.

mqtrmor,"From the article:  A federal judge ordered the North Carolina Board of Elections on Monday to certify the results of the state’s Supreme Court election, giving Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs the upper hand in the still-contested race.  Chief U.S. District Judge Richard E. Myers ruled Monday that the state board must certify the results of the November election, which have been the target of legal challenges by Republican Judge Jefferson Griffin.  Last month, the state’s Supreme Court mandated that the majority of the contested ballots be counted in the race. In a 4-2 ruling, the state’s high court determined that ballots containing missing information, including Social Security numbers, from legal voters were still valid.  “Under this Court’s longstanding precedent, mistakes made by negligent election officials in registering citizens who are otherwise eligible to vote will not deprive the citizens of their right to vote or render their vote void after they have been cast,” North Carolina’s Supreme Court previously said.  Myers’s Monday ruling stated the ballots challenged by Griffin should be counted, stating the “retroactive invalidation of absentee ballots cast by overseas military and civilian voters violates those voters’ substantive due process rights.”  Griffin has seven days to appeal before the order takes effect.  “This consolidated action concerns an attempt to change the rules of the game after it had been played,” Myers wrote of Griffin’s challenges in the 68-page ruling.",1746502047.0,kootles10,politics,t3_1kfuxj3,t3_1kfuxj3,1,/r/politics/comments/1kfuxj3/federal_judge_orders_nc_to_certify_state_supreme/mqtrmor/

I don't see any Muslim's in Trumps circle, or in his Party for that matter.  Why would Trump go against AIPAC and the Evangelicals?  He won't criticize Israel.  He, and his party will give money and weapons to Israel when they ask and he won't say anything about how they use them.

mqu7h3q,"The fundamental problem is that Democrats don't know how to talk to people, and (perhaps more importantly) don't know how to sympathize with people. Democrats do a poor job acknowledging people's pain.   Democrats will often do a whole big song and dance that basically goes ""I don't understand what the big deal is, here's a series of facts explaining why your feelings are wrong.""   In the case of the economy for example, your average Democrat leader will say things like, ""What are you talking about? The economy is great! Look at the stock market! Look at the unemployment rate! Look at the GDP!"" It does nothing to acknowledge their pain and suffering, and essentially makes them look crazy.  All of those metrics are worthless if you are working two jobs and are still struggling to make ends meet.   This is something the Republicans do very well, but only for the wrong reason. They will say, ""We feel you. The economy is terrible, and it's because of the Democrat's weak border policy and influx of illegal immigrants. If we win, we will deport all of them which will improve the cost of living.""   Republicans validate emotions, blame some marginalized group, and claim to be able to fix it.   Bernie Sanders (and AOC to some degree) is able to do this well. If you listen to him talk about the economy, he essentially starts by saying ""the economy is rigged against you, your pain is valid"" and then blames the appropriate parties (corporate greed, big money in politics) and proposes policy solutions to fix it.",1746509364.0,walkallover1991,politics,t3_1kftxfi,t1_mqu3308,1,/r/politics/comments/1kftxfi/axios_senate_democrats_have_invited_new_york/mqu7h3q/

mqu8ybe,"We’ve been steeped in individualism for too long. Too many folks are busy “putting on their own oxygen masks” (so to speak).

Comparatively, broadly speaking, parents of today seemingly go to great lengths to make sure their kids are far safer, more prepared, and better informed than the generation that birthed them.

mqtavzh,"Here is the beginning of the story:  Following online outrage from the right, the House canceled a planned vote on the [IGO Anti-Boycott Act](https://jewishinsider.com/2023/05/mike-lawler-josh-gottheimer-bds-anti-boycott-law/), legislation expanding current U.S. anti-boycott laws to include international organizations, despite broad bipartisan support for the legislation last year.  The fallout is just one recent example of how actors on the political fringes have mobilized to stymie pro-Israel legislation and bills to combat antisemitism that otherwise enjoy bipartisan support — often by misrepresenting their aims and impacts — and have ammassed sufficient influence to upend that bipartisan consensus and scuttle the legislative process.  The bill expands [current U.S. anti-boycott laws](https://jewishinsider.com/2022/10/commerce-department-arab-league-israel-boycott-american-jewish-committee/) first passed in the 1970s, primarily as a counter to the Arab League’s boycott of Israel. [Additional authorities](https://www.congress.gov/115/plaws/publ232/PLAW-115publ232.pdf) and guidelines were passed into law in 2018 under President Donald Trump. The existing law imposes penalties for companies or individuals which comply with or facilitate compulsory foreign boycotts of U.S. allies as a condition of doing business in foreign countries.   The new law would apply to potential boycott policies enforced by international organizations like the United Nations or European Union.  Bipartisan support for identical legislation last year was so strong that it passed the House by a voice vote in February 2024, after being [reported out of the House Foreign Affairs Committee by a 42-3 vote](https://jewishinsider.com/2023/12/house-foreign-affairs-committee-anti-boycott-laws-human-shields-terrorists/) in late 2023. But this year, it’s meeting a very different reception.  The legislation as written does not ban or criminalize boycotts of Israel by U.S. citizens or companies undertaken outside of compulsory policies by international organizations, nor does it punish Americans who do not purchase Israeli goods. Current law specifically states that “the mere absence of a business relationship” in the boycotted country is not sufficient evidence of a boycott under the law. But some on the right took to X on Sunday to claim otherwise.",1746495836.0,jewish_insider,politics,t3_1kfsyi1,t3_1kfsyi1,1,/r/politics/comments/1kfsyi1/house_cancels_vote_on_igo_antiboycott_act/mqtavzh/

mqti10v,"First, let’s get some facts straight (please be objective here).  El Salvador had a brutal civil war during the 1980s meant to prevent the spread of communism, and it was supported by the US. Out of those communists came out the political party known as FMLN, which is a Socialist party. After the war, most Conservatives fled the country giving FMLN a majority. Some of them were corrupt, giving FMLN a bad name. But FMLN is an inclusive party. Bukele’s family is actually from Palestine, but his family moved to El Salvador and were able to build massive wealth with ownership in media companies. Long story short, Bukele would never be allowed in Conservative parties so he went to FMLN.   This allowed him to become mayor of its most populous city. He had tried his whole agenda of economic revitalization there but failed badly. As mayor, he tried to solve the gang problem by establishing a truce between gangs. Most Americans have no idea why this is so bad, but it’s a terrible move. In Mexico, one politician tried a truce between cartels, but this truce was unknown to the public, and it was the drug cartels who exposed this politician for letting drug cartels run their shady business as long as it was kept away from the public(so still executions and kidnappings, but complete media blackout). Basically, Bukele is telling the gangs that he will give them complete media blackout as long as they obey when he tells them to stay away from the issues hethat affect him. This would mean that gang members execute people deep inside the jungle where no one will ever know about it.   Long story short, this gang member had a media personality and it allowed politicians to use it when they needed political bonus points. Now this gang member was able to flee and is in some other country exposing Bukele. And this hurts him because it shows that he is willing to let gang members do what they want so long as it benefits him ",1746498321.0,JollyToby0220,politics,t3_1kfsxuy,t1_mqtaz3b,1,/r/politics/comments/1kfsxuy/trump_ally_bukele_reportedly_set_to_arrest/mqti10v/

mqt8he3,"🥨 The Convergence of Political Influence and Financial Enterprise.       Donald Trump's political influence and financial ventures- Including MAGA Inc., Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), Truth Social, DJT stock, and the $TRUMP and $MELANIA cryptocurrencies illustrate a complex ecosystem where political capital is leveraged for financial gain.         This convergence raises significant ethical concerns and potential avenues for exploitation in both political and financial arenas.           -----------------   MAGA Inc.: Political Fundraising with Financial Implications.       MAGA Inc. serves as a super PAC supporting Donald Trump's political campaigns.       While its primary function is political fundraising, the PAC's activities can indirectly influence Trump's financial ventures.         For instance, heightened political activity and media coverage can drive user engagement on platforms like Truth Social, potentially boosting the value of associated stocks and cryptocurrencies.       This symbiotic relationship blurs the lines between political advocacy and financial profiteering.        ---------------------   🗞 Trump Media & Technology Group and Truth Social: Merging Politics with Business.       TMTG, the parent company of Truth Social, exemplifies the fusion of political branding with commercial enterprise.      After merging with Digital World Acquisition Corp., TMTG went public under the ticker DJT. Trump holds a significant stake in the company, valued at approximately $4.6 billion.         The platform's user base and engagement levels are closely tied to Trump's political prominence, making the company's financial performance susceptible to political events.       This intertwining raises concerns about the use of political office to drive personal financial gain.            --------------------   🪙 $TRUMP and $MELANIA Coins: Cryptocurrencies with Political Overtones.        The launch of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins introduced a new dimension to the monetization of political identity.      These cryptocurrencies experienced significant volatility, with $TRUMP reaching a market capitalization of $7.5 billion shortly after launch.      However, the coins have been criticized for their speculative nature and potential conflicts of interest, especially given Trump's role in shaping cryptocurrency policy.         Ethics experts have raised concerns about the possibility of these coins being used to circumvent campaign finance laws or as vehicles for foreign entities to gain influence.        ---------------------   🪙 Token Performance Snapshot:        $TRUMP:       Launch Price: ~$10.      Peak Price: $74.59.       Current: ~$11.21.      Decline: ~85%        $MELANIA:        Peak Price: $13.73.       Current: ~$0.33.      Decline: ~97.6%        These steep drops reinforce concerns about volatility, speculation, and potential manipulation in politically branded crypto assets.        ---------------------   🍽 Mar-a-Lago: Monetizing Access to Political Power   Recent reports indicate that business leaders are paying substantial sums up to $5 million for one-on-one meetings and $1 million for group dinners-to dine with President Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate.       These events, organized by MAGA Inc., blur the lines between political fundraising and personal enrichment.       The lack of transparency regarding the allocation of these funds and the potential for policy influence raises serious ethical and constitutional concerns, particularly in relation to the Emoluments Clause.          ----------------------   💰 Foundations and Financial Misconduct: A Pattern of Self-Dealing.       Investigations into the Eric Trump Foundation and the Donald J. Trump Foundation have revealed troubling patterns of financial misconduct, including potential charity fraud and tax evasion.       The Eric Trump Foundation claimed to use Trump Organization golf courses free of charge for fundraising events, but financial records and eyewitness accounts show that the charity was billed over $1.2 million- much of it paid directly to Trump-owned businesses.        Experts noted that the costs, such as a $322,000 charge for a single event, far exceeded reasonable market rates, indicating self-dealing and deceptive donor practices.       Similarly, the Donald J. Trump Foundation repeatedly used charitable funds for personal expenses, such as buying Trump portraits and making political contributions, clear violations of nonprofit laws.       While establishing criminal intent is challenging, the documented behavior suggests a misuse of charitable organizations for personal enrichment that merits legal scrutiny.         ------------------   Asset Management and Conflict of Interest:       While Trump's assets are nominally held in a revocable trust managed by his son, this arrangement does little to resolve concerns about conflicts of interest.      The structure enables Trump to benefit indirectly from policy decisions that affect his holdings- particularly in emerging sectors like cryptocurrency.        Legal scholars have also raised Emoluments Clause concerns, especially regarding potential foreign investment in Trump-affiliated businesses, which could be interpreted as constitutionally impermissible.        --------------",1746495016.0,Ok-Amphibian3164,politics,t3_1kfs1q7,t3_1kfs1q7,1,/r/politics/comments/1kfs1q7/trumps_meme_coin_business_racks_up_fees_as_buyers/mqt8he3/

mqtkrx6,"I'm not sure if ""No True Scotsman"" is the way out of this.  From libertarianism.org  > When ordinary people aren’t careful to respect their neighbors’ privacy, or presume to boss other people about or physically interfere with them, those of us concerned with justice and civility object. We might say: “Stop that. Mind your own business.” But the agents of the state act like the same rules don’t apply to them. Once they decide they want to do a thing, they generally don’t stop to consider whether doing it is any of their business in the first place, or whether they’re going about doing it in a way that disrespects the dignity or autonomy of their fellows. Legislators, bureaucrats, police, and other agents who enforce the state’s commands treat other people as pawns on a chessboard to be maneuvered into whatever configuration they deem best. Too many fail to see people as independent agents with their own desires and plans. That’s true even in relatively free societies.  What this screed fails to cover is _who_ keeps your neighbors out of your business? The rallying cry of ""the state is oppression!!"" is more important than explaining how things _should_ work.

mqtpyqj,"Knowingly polluting a river could cause others to become sick, which would violate the NAP. Looking through the lens of libertarianism, that would be against the tenets of the party.  As for _who_ should be keeping your neighbors out of your business, the answer is quite clear. There is a need for enforcement in every civilized country. Even in a home, you'll see this play out. A child steals money from their sibling to buy something they want. Who enforces the rules? A parental figure. But where an authoritarian figure may look to physical reprimands or yelling (is it any wonder why Republicans lean towards spanking as an acceptable punishment?), I think we'd both agree that a more open minded individual would take a less invasive and aggressive approach.  I apply the same mindset to 'the state.' Should we have facial recognition cameras on every corner? No.  Should we try to anticipate _who_ will commit a crime like Palantir seems to be aiming for? No.  Should we still entertain the death penalty? No.  There is a solid case for enforcement but it quickly gets out of hand and unconstitutional. Look at what is happening right now with deportations. Look at what has happened in the last with ICE, the DEA, and ATF. There is always overreach. Does that mean that they are entirely bad? No. But there is no enforcement for the enforcement, and that is dangerous for the liberty of all.
