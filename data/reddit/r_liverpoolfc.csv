mquexbn,Macca 100 percent. Klopps son  Macca always 💯 involved. Scores bangers when needed and has simply gone from strength to strength. Even against Chelsea you could see him rally the team when he came on.  Then from strategic POV. Could be opportunity to offer macca new contract and new terms to make it very difficult for Madrid to sign him. They usually start making approaches for players pretty early on.,1746513607.0,hgjayhvkk,liverpoolfc,t3_1kfxw18,t3_1kfxw18,24,/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1kfxw18/who_would_you_give_vice_captaincy/mquexbn/

We need someone who appreciates the club and is in it for the long haul, someone to step up when VVD has to step down.

He's also probably close to Van Dijk, the current captain, given they're both Dutch so he could learn leadership qualities easier.

mqu4m54,"It's nice work. But I fear that the goal scored alone is too little data to judge a striker, especially given that half of the teams in Portugal are in the Championship or a lower level. This doesn't mean all players in Portugal are bad, but it's really hard to judge them by an abstract output like goals scored. I remember Núñez had 2.7 successful dribbles per game with Benfica. I thought, ""Oh, his technique must be decent,"" but we know the truth now; his successful dribbles per game in the EPL are almost zero. I'm not saying Gyökeres is the same as Núñez, but the point here is that abstract data hardly gives us correct information.  And second, scoring goals is a big part of a striker's life. But with the context that Salah is still our main focus for at least another year, and Slot has said many times he wants his striker to act like a number 10 on many occasions, I think we will focus a lot on how good he is with the ball, how good he is in make play, and also in passing.

And a lot of his goal highlights has plenty of shitty defending from the opposition.   I'm not worried about his ability to score goals, he looks a fantastic finisher and a good fit for how we create chances. I do worry about his general play because he'll come up against CBs that are both bigger and faster than him and it will take some adjusting. We also have to accept that he probably won't get any better if he struggles because he's already in his prime. ",1746507345.0,OneWingedAngelfan,liverpoolfc,t3_1kfvplg,t3_1kfvplg,10,/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1kfvplg/evaluating_potential_center_forwards_or_how_i/mqu3jaa/

mqucm9m,"Great data here, thank you for doing this. Also shows the paucity of forward transfer options as well imo, none of these really get me out of my seat. Gyokeres stands out in the face of this data, I agree with you and this has actually pulled him up in my own personal rankings of forwards I want most. But there’s still always the question of fit and the question of how much stronger is the prem than the Portuguese league, which I find hard to quantify (as do you you noted.)  I also currently really like Isak and this doesn’t change that though his injuries are a worry for sure. I’m sad that this data makes Ekitike look so bad as well as he was my other favorite, but I think that’s inevitable when for a quarter of this data’s time he was barely playing or getting used to a new club at 20. A useful reminder he’s only had one, maybe one and a half TOP seasons but that’s something I already knew and I like him anyways.  Also, obviously, some of this data is biased by the player’s teams. I particularly find Alvarez’s Att Touches p/90 to not really be indicative of him as a player but more of an ultra defensive Simeone style and a Pep style where the striker is much less involved in buildup than years past. Would be interesting to add international data for some of these where available, but thank you for compiling all these, definitely and interesting read and helped distract me from the rest of the bs happening so thanks OP :)",1746512236.0,kjexclamation,liverpoolfc,t3_1kfvplg,t3_1kfvplg,3,/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1kfvplg/evaluating_potential_center_forwards_or_how_i/mqucm9m/
mqud4gr,"Joao Pedro for me please. The link up play with Mo will be awesome.

Dribbles and drives forward like a champ, passes like a playmaker, moves around like a busy bee, scores goals, does flicks and trick, takes pens and free kicks. He has a huge frame and long strides.  As a 9 in this system I think he would be absolutely fantastic. Players around him would benefit greatly from his presence, more so than Darwin and Jota. Main issue is availability but this can be improved in house.   It’s clear the way Slot has used his 9’s that he likes them to participate in the build up.

mqswixy,"Pretty ironic for everyone here to be calling him greedy when they’re complaining specifically about him leaving on a free rather than what - trying to ensure FSG get £70m - seems pretty greedy to me. Why should he care that his employer gets some money when he leaves? He literally won us a Champions League with his corner taken quickly. He played a massive part in winning us trophies, and is partly responsible for some of the greatest sports memories of my life. If he wants to try living in a new country, playing with new players (including his seemingly good friend), after he’s accomplished everything with his boyhood club - so be it. I’m not gonna cheer for him or Real Madrid, but I’ll always appreciate what he’s given our club, and the mural represents that. I don’t know how some people feel that him leaving for free rather than £70m somehow erases everything he gave us for the last 8 years.

mqt2q5r,"I know there's almost a tribalistic urge to really hate on Trent right now, and from a fan perspective it does make sense to be critical of him leaving us when we're in a very good place and he's had the opportunity to win it all with his boyhood club. I was genuinely hoping against hope that he'd somehow stay even though the writing was on the wall for a long time now, and a large part of me is still frustrated that he couldn't show the power of loyalty over anything, as others have done before him, though those kinds of character traits and decisions don't come as easily in the environment of modern football, I suppose.  All that being said, I think many fans are just taking the vitriol too far with the Trent erasure. He was an absolutely vital part of all our success these last seven or eight years, and despite some disappointment in his attitude at times, I think he honestly loves the club through thick and thin. Klopp leaving and the allure of Real were blows that couldn't negate his potential inclinations to stay, and I understand that he wants to diversify his experience as a footballer in another context, with the largest club on the planet to boot. I don't think that takes away from everything he did with us, for us, and as part of the team. He won everything. and became a world class player doing so, a uniquely brilliant passer with many iconic moments to remember.  So I am sad and a bit disappointed personally, yes, but I refuse to act like we should slag Trent and purge him from all the great moments and legacies he helped create. He was utterly instrumental in so much of what we experienced as fans, so a level of dignity and appreciation should be maintained, even amidst the bothersome and harsh reality of how he is leaving us. He did everything with us, and that is worthy of respect. I wish him all the best (unless Real play us, then I hope he gets torched and we smash them), and he will always hold a special place in my heart as a fan along with all the other Klopp-era greats we have had from 2019 onwards. He's a part of our history, keep the damn mural! We can be upset, but let's also be proud of his achievements with us, not bitter about his decision now.

Regarding the transfer fee, how does it show a lack of respect? He’s still put in a ton of effort and done a lot for the club.

We definitely invested money in Trent over the past 20 years but only because he could help us win more. No fee was ever paid for him, he never topped the club’s list of earners, so idk that he necessarily “owes” us anything.

They had bigger names a couple seasons ago and it was impossible to make it work, the side was constantly unbalanced because they had 3-4 players that had no work rate without the ball.   La Liga is worlds away from the PL in terms of competitiveness and quality so they will still have domestic success but in Europe I think they will get outworked and out fought.

One of the fundemental things that defenders are taught at academy level is the distance you put between yourself and the attacker when you close them down or jockey them on the touchline. As a rule of thumb, you are taught to stand about an arm's length from the attacker.      For years, i have literally watched this guy defend about 12 feet away from attackers, with his body position completely wrong, he just doesn't have it in his blood to defend, you either get it or you don't, and he certainly doesn't get it.      I think he's a victim of his era, by trade he is a right-mid from a past generation in a 4-4-2 formation.

That said, one thing that has really pissed me off about him the last couple of years is how lackadaisical he became for large stretches. It felt like he thought he was only there to ping killer passes and when it came to aggressively tracking back or pressing, he was way too civilian about it.  I still think the people in the club aren't as sad to see him go as we probably think they are. World class in some aspects, but you have to do a lot to consistently even out those world class qualities with the trade offs they create.

mqtig2t,"I'm really struggling with how to feel about Trent right now. As a relatively older Liverpool fan—old enough to have seen glimpses of Barnes and Rush, Fowler, Owen, Macca, and of course Gerrard and Carra—I’ve seen generations of legends come and go. In recent years, few players have had the kind of impact on the new Liverpool era that Trent Alexander-Arnold has had.  To my nine-year-old niece and nephew, Trent is Liverpool. They’ve grown up knowing and loving football through him. My younger brother, with whom I've built a lifelong bond through Liverpool and football, is Trent’s biggest fan. And for me, for quite some time, Trent was one of the best players in the world—essential to our identity as a club.  Liverpool Football Club, and especially this era under Klopp, got me—and I’m sure many others—through some of the darkest times. It helped me cope during the pandemic, helped me through the loss of my father, through losing my job, through depression. Trent was part of that. So were Bobby, Sadio, Gini, Origi, Virg, Mo, and Ali. These players weren’t just footballers; they were lifelines. So no—I can't hate him. I love him. But I also feel completely betrayed.  He’s leaving for the worst possible club. A club that arguably cost us three more Champions League titles. A club whose players once injured one of ours so badly, it changed the course of a final. A club that represents everything we despise about modern football. And he’s going there on a free transfer.  He’s leaving his boyhood club, his home, the memories—everything—for our biggest rivals. And he’s not even leaving with anything to show for it.

It hurts because he chose to leave for Real Madrid, a club that is fucking annoying and our constant rival while Trent has played for us.  But it doesnt hurt any more because of a lack of transfer fee - or at least it doesnt make me any more angry. We are massively underfunded by FSG vs our competitors and while that stays the case I wont support their balance sheet particularly.  He probably did the right thing for his family, he'll get paid probably 4+ seasons pay in a signing bonus vs what he was on for us. And then will earn more there per season. The fundamental issue is transfer fees and how large they are vs player salaries.  We should absolutely be using similar tactics to Real Madrid and using our EPL & recent UCL win to trumpet us as one of the best places to come and play football/win trophies/be part of something huge. The problem is that the cheaters massively overpay for whatever scraps are left over after RM/Barca take their pick.

mqr1jyt,"According to our editorial team, VfB Stuttgart midfielder Angelo Stiller has become a major focus of Liverpool FC. The Anfield Reds have signaled serious interest in signing the German international this summer. Dutch head coach Arne Slot's team secured the 20th English title in the club's history just eight days ago.  Liverpool are now thoroughly considering their squad structure for the coming season, in which Stiller is expected to become a key new element in central midfield. The 23-year-old, who joined Stuttgart from TSG Hoffenheim in the summer of 2023, only extended his contract with VfB Stuttgart until 2028 in January.  But the offer from northern England is likely to be financially significant. The €60 million mark is the threshold beyond which even those in charge in Stuttgart, including CEO Alexander Wehrle and sporting director Fabian Wohlgemuth, are likely to start pondering, despite Stiller's importance for VfB's game. But the message from England is clear: Liverpool want to pry Stiller away from VfB Stuttgart if possible. Just as they did with former captain Wataru Endo in 2023, who hasn't established himself as a regular at Anfield with only 18 short Premier League appearances. Endo, already 32, cost around €20 million at the time. Stiller, 23, is now expected to fetch three times that. Meanwhile, rumors that left-back Maximilian Mittelstädt was considering a move to SSC Napoli have been false. Several Italian media outlets had reported this. The 28-year-old did indeed recently visit the city on Mount Vesuvius, but the rumored meeting with SSC sporting director Giovanni Manna never took place.

mquhuim,It might just be that there are other more pressing concerns in the squad. Hopefully Bajcetic can come back in and get back to those pre injury levels and offer a rotation option for Gravenberch. I'd love Stiller though and maybe offer them Endo back to reduce the amount. But I can see why another midfielder might be pushed out till Summer '26.,1746515407.0,PersephoneTheOG,liverpoolfc,t3_1kfj2s5,t1_mqr85jj,1,/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1kfj2s5/liverpool_fc_is_seriously_interested_in_angelo/mquhuim/
