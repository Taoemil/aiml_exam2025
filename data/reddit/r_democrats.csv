mqth8qn,">In a statement to Vogue, Harris praised the work of the Costume Institute, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art more broadly, for giving trenchant, agenda-setting examples of creativity‚Äîsuch as the ones on display in ‚ÄúSuperfine,‚Äù which positions the Black dandy as an icon of self-determination and resistance‚Äîa platform.  >‚ÄúArt has always had a significant impact on not just culture, but also our policies and politics,‚Äù Harris said. ‚ÄúArtistic expression‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs dance, music, visual arts, or fashion‚Äîhas a way of capturing the mood and language of the people without words.

The competence, the austere reverence for the office, the novel diversity our first woman President‚Ä¶  thrown away for a second term for some con artist shit-stained moron who can barely garble out two consecutive sentences beyond a third-grade reading level as he smears bronzer on his face, yells and tantrums about the movie he saw last night while stuffing his face with McDonald‚Äôs and Diet Coke. This man, who will soon declare he had a hole in one on every hole in his golf tournament, who cheats on his wife with prostitutes, who posts iconography of himself as The Pope, a rapist and grabber who brags about wanting to fuck his own daughter and walks backstage amongst teenage pageant contestants teeming with sycophantic yes-men and yes-women who will not stand idly by, but actively pervert the constitution in his favor. Pam Bondi, the little nazi, who will send to camps the multitudes for even standing in defiance of his wrath, a wrath unconcerned with the constitution or due process or human rights. A man whose family is banned from operating charities for stealing money from cancer patients, a man whose family is banned from academia for running a fake for-profit university, a man who has bankrupted 6 times including casinos, a man who has discriminated against minorities and even now sends American Citizens abroad with reckless abandon status known or unknown. Fascism is here, and his supporters religiously accept their current capitalistic persecution of down markets in favor of the promise of a future consisting of an all-white Amerikkka. You cannot stop fascism by protest or democratic means. To stop fascism is to go to war. It marches ever onward and must be stopped by bullets and shelling alone. The Nuremberg trials proved that the root of all evil is a lack of empathy, and this man and his voters are a lack of empathy in aggregate.

mqltqgp,"Of course he has the red light Saber. In step wars lore the color of the light saber is from the crystal that effectively chooses you based on who you are as a person   Rule of two.  ‚ÄúThe origins and meaning of red lightsabers in Star Wars are deeply tied to power, aggression, and the unrelenting dominance of the Dark Side.   Red lightsabers are notorious in Star Wars as a weapon carried by the most villainous of characters, the Sith. These villains had one life purpose: to eliminate the Jedi Order and gain control as tyrants throughout the galaxy.  The Sith followed the rule of two , which dictated that there would be one master and one apprentice. The apprentice would cleanse themselves of all physical and mental shortcomings, in many cases being controlled by their master until their soul was broken. While this purpose uniformly united most Sith, there were many instances throughout history in which red lightsaber users, including Sith Lords, would stray from this common goal to pursue their own conquests.‚Äù  https://ultrasabers.com/holocron/what-is-the-meaning-of-the-red-lightsaber/?srsltid=AfmBOopcvpRNO8aTJgR9iWsd5ucDGOnRKtpqAH4Xpe7zBXlCrT_mWXlg",1746395045.0,Oceanbreeze871,democrats,t3_1keu1ck,t3_1keu1ck,9,/r/democrats/comments/1keu1ck/trumps_a_sack_of_sith/mqltqgp/

Dolan is seen as an ally of Trump though he apparently hasn't yet sunk to the level of obsequiousness demonstrated by Capitol Hill Republicans.   Apart from Trumpian ego, it's baffling what benefit a non-Catholic serial public violator of the Ten Commandments thought he would gain by creating and posting such an image.   J.D.
