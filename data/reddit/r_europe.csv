As a starting point, six key domains that are nearly universally desired across cultures will be assessed, along with various other aspects of well-being. Each domain has a basis in the humanities and social science literature as a critical aspect of an individual’s overall well-being:   1. happiness and life satisfaction   2. mental and physical health   3. meaning and purpose   4. character and virtue   5. close social relationships   6. financial and material stability",1746515927.0,Affectionate_Cat293,europe,t3_1kfyhhk,t3_1kfyhhk,1,/r/europe/comments/1kfyhhk/poland_leads_europe_in_wellbeing_across_key_life/mquinu9/

mquky7v,"I agree. Learning and settling the native language of the land is pre-requisite of integration.  Skilled researchers (and skilled labor even) may not want to push through this barrier, and that's why Europe is not the first choice of many skilled researchers.  This invitation wants to invite people to come and research, and instead of making it easy and help focus on research, the politics and implied (but understandable) requirement of integration will want them to divert major part of attention learning a language. It's a bad investment even from EU's PoV.  Not to mention the fear that other EU countries will follow the Dutch government and cut the funding anyway as the right in their countries keep gaining more votes.  Immigration and economic refugee is a separate can of worms. Italy profits from 'economic refugee' almost same as USA does. Most of the workers in farms are asylee whose labor is extracted at far cheaper rate, or in factories with exploitative rates, or in restaurants on out of sight jobs where they are overworked to hell. Italy is smart(er) enough to know that.  When the country votes in the openly facist party, is uneducated (among worst in Europe), it's not that businesses are liberal enough to hire internationals. It's most of the time exploitation of people who will do anything to live in a slightly better place and will do the job that was never going to be taken by natives anyway.  One can't complain that (1) Economic refugees are burden, (2) they take our jobs in the same breath. Italy, an agricultural, and old mechanical industry land, is profiting from 'economic' refugees.

His lack of response to the 2008 Russo-Georgian War signaled to Russia that its aggression would go largely unchecked. Early in his presidency, he abandoned missile defense plans in Poland and Czechia, suggesting that Eastern Europe was up for negotiation. He took no decisive action during the 2014 annexation of Crimea, issuing sanctions so mild they were largely symbolic. During his tenure, Russia repeatedly tested NATO’s resolve — in Ukraine, in Syria, and through a surge in cyberattacks.  His lofty speeches often clashed with his (in)actions. While he spoke of defending democracy and ensuring security, his foreign policy left alliances strained, European security weakened, and Russia increasingly emboldened.

mqst0fr,Australia and New Zealand are colonised nations that have fucked off its native population from any real political power and while the more informed unaverage citizen may respect that line of history and culture of the native. Institutional power has fucked them off into irrelevancy.   Any leader of the native population in the past standing up against a colonial government would not have been celebrating or seen kindly by the history books in your curriculum. It goes against the dominant culture and legitimacy of your governments.  A niche example you brought up to undermine historical significance of consequence does not fit here. The irrelevance on native leaders in being recognised and awarded with the prize of recognition is not given the slightest amount of generosity from either society.   Incorrect?

mqrdxi5,"**Ukrainian soldiers joined a military parade in London as the U.K. marked 80 years since the Allies’ defeat of Nazi Germany.**  Eleven Ukrainians were among 1,300 people who marched through the heart of the British capital on a route stretching from Parliament to Buckingham Palace.      The Ukrainian forces, carrying the country’s bright blue-and-yellow flag, were greeted with applause by onlookers, including members of the royal family, the BBC reported      King Charles, Queen Camilla, and the Prince and Princess of Wales were among those in attendance.      British defense officials said that the Ukrainians’ presence in the parade was a symbol of support for Kyiv’s “continued fight for freedom against Russia’s unprovoked, illegal invasion.”      Speaking to the British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) ahead of the parade, Captain Andriy Khomyshin, military chaplain at the Lviv National Army Academy, said he was “proud” to participate.      “It’s a big honor to participate in this parade as a part of the free world, and to represent our nation, our fighting nation, our military, who are \[in\] the worst condition on the frontline, fighting for our freedom,” he said.      Monday’s official commemorations of VE Day in the British capital started with the chiming of the bells of Big Ben, the iconic clocktower at the British Houses of Parliament, and a reading of wartime leader Winston Churchill’s victory speech in 1945.      After the parade, crowds watched modern and historic military jets flying over Buckingham Palace, led by the RAF’s iconic Lancaster bomber.

A lot of troops that kept the USSR in the war in 1941-42 were troops released from the Far East, because they knew Japan weren't going to enter the war against the Soviets, because they were dealing with the UK and US.  3. A massive problem for the Germans was the need to get a reliable source of oil, not to mention all the other critical resources from the USSR. Well... if the US and UK hadn't been opposed to the Nazis, guess what? Germany would've been able to simply trade for the gas, manganese, chromium, etc... it needed.  4. The Lufftwaffe was being constantly pressured and drained by US and UK bombing. A full-force, concentrated Lufftwaffe would've given more victories, done even more material damage to the Red Army.  The USSR was very close to actual collapse. A few things changing would've changed the entire outcome. I've seen people do the math. If you take every single tank the USSR was capable of producing, it wouldn't have been enough. They would've run out of tanks before stopping the Nazis. They would've run out of trucks. They would've run out of most things.  Lend-lease, and pulling the attention and focus of the Axis away, and not allowing Germany and Japan to get their hands on critical resources, played a massive role in the USSR rolling the Germans back.",1746516897.0,Another-attempt42,europe,t3_1kfh9qv,t1_mquiw1d,1,/r/europe/comments/1kfh9qv/ukrainian_soldiers_march_through_london_as_uk/mquk5u2/

mqreain,"Opposition candidate Karol Nawrocki, one of the two favourites to win Poland’s upcoming presidential election, has denied any wrongdoing after it emerged that he owns a second apartment, having declared in a recent TV debate that he only has one.  He suggests that the story has been “blown out of proportion” by media hostile towards him and even that the state security services were involved in creating the scandal.  However, leading figures from the ruling coalition, including a deputy prime minister, have said that Nawrocki has serious questions to answer about the revelations and that the information revealed so far undermines his credibility as a potential president.    The controversy was sparked by remarks that Nawrocki, the candidate supported by the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS), made during [last week’s presidential debate](https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/04/29/presidential-candidate-reports-far-right-rival-to-prosecutors-for-antisemitic-remarks-during-tv-debate/), in which he expressed opposition to a proposed property tax.  He said that he would “defend” Poles against the tax and that he was “speaking on behalf of ordinary Poles, like me, who have one apartment”.  However, shortly afterwards, news website Onet reported that Nawrocki in fact owns two apartments: one, a three-room 60m² property in Gdańsk, where he lives with his family; the second, also in Gdańsk, a 28.5m² studio.  Onet noted that, while the larger apartment was bought by Nawrocki and his wife with a mortgage, the second was obtained by them in 2017 from a man named only as Jerzy Ż. Five years earlier, they had already signed a preliminary agreement for the property.    In response, Nawrocki’s campaign spokeswoman, Emilia Wierzbicki, issued a statement on Wednesday last week saying that Nawrocki had always included all of his properties in asset declarations he had made and that his family “does not receive any income from owning the property” in question.  She added that the apartment “is at the disposal of a person who, for many years… Karol Nawrocki was the only one caring for”.  On Sunday evening, ahead of a further article about the apartment due to be published by Onet on Monday, Wierzbicki released another statement outlining how “Nawrocki has been helping Jerzy, who is a disabled person living alone, for many years.”    “Karol Nawrocki gave Jerzy money to buy the apartment, which Jerzy promised to give to Nawrocki in exchange for the help he provided,” she added. “When Jerzy came into conflict with the law, he continued to ask Karol Nawrocki for help many times and always received it.”  Wierzbicki said that this support had continued even after Nawrocki became the owner of the apartment, which Jerzy Ż continued to use. “Karol Nawrocki never lived in this apartment, never rented it out, nor did he derive any financial benefit from it.”  “The use of \[this\] case to attack Karol Nawarocki proves that the security services are engaged in a dirty campaign,” wrote the spokeswoman. “We have received information that a group of people is working on this, whose goal is to provide information from Karol Nawrocki’s personal security forms to the media.”",1746473716.0,dat_9600gt_user,europe,t3_1kfh9r8,t3_1kfh9r8,0,/r/europe/comments/1kfh9r8/polish_opposition_presidential_candidate_nawrocki/mqreain/
mqrebap,"In her latest statement, Wierzbicki said that Nawrocki had lost contact with Jerzy Ż last year, when he was no longer able to locate him. In their article published today, Onet reported that this is because Jerzy Ż, aged 80, is now living in a state nursing home.  The website said that Nawrocki’s campaign had for days been refusing to respond to their journalists’ questions and that Wierzbicki’s statement on Sunday contained “many inaccuracies”.  Onet reported that the city of Gdańsk had been paying almost 100,000 zloty a year for Jerzy Ż’s care and that Nawrocki “does not contribute a penny”.    On Monday, Nawrocki himself then addressed the issue at a press conference. He said that he had been “taking care of an old, sick man who was my neighbour for years”.  Nawrocki confirmed that the situation “ultimately ended with me being the legal owner of the apartment, to which I do not have keys, because this man lived in this apartment and I did not derive any benefits from it”.  “If there is a legal possibility to publish my financial declaration, I will do it,” he added. When Nawrocki was asked why he did not contact the police when he was unable to find Jerzy Ż last year, he did not answer. Nor did he respond to questions asking how much he paid for the apartment.  Like Wierzbicki, Nawrocki suggested that the state security services were behind the story. “The Internal Security Agency (ABW) has joined the Polish institutions helping Rafal Trzaskowski,” said Nawrocki, referring to the candidate of Poland’s main ruling party, the centrist Civic Platform (PO).    Government figures, however, say that Nawrocki still has many questions to answer. They also claim that the details revealed so far indicate that Nawrocki is not fit to be president.  The fact that Nawrocki simply lost contact with Jerzy Ż “looks bad”, said deputy prime minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz. “Just as Nawrocki did not take care of Jerzy, as he had committed to do, he also will not take care of Poland \[if elected president\].”  “Lies, deceit, contempt, greed and heartlessness – and, for camouflage, covered with fake charity and care,” wrote education minister Barbara Nowacka. “Sound familiar? Yes!! Eight years of their \[PiS\] rule were like that too.”    Meanwhile, Anna-Maria Żukowska, head of the parliamentary caucus of The Left (Lewica), one of Poland’s ruling parties, said that Nawrocki’s claims he had not lived in or profited from the apartment are irrelevant given that ownership of it may have significantly increased his wealth.  She asked for further information on what terms the Nawrockis had bought the property. “And all this involving a disabled elderly person who, on top of that, fell into legal troubles (debts?), whose tragic situation you exploited, only to later check if he’s even alive once a year at Christmas.”  Nawrocki, who is president of the state Institute of National Remembrance (IPN), was named last year as the candidate PiS would support in the presidential elections. He is currently running second in the polls, behind Trzaskowski, the mayor of Warsaw.  In recent weeks Nawrocki has [significantly closed the polling gap to Trzaskowski](https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/05/01/whats-gone-wrong-for-polands-presidential-frontrunner-trzaskowski-four-theories/) ahead of the first round of the elections on 18 May. If, as likely, no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote, a run-off between the top two will take place on 1 June.",1746473722.0,dat_9600gt_user,europe,t3_1kfh9r8,t1_mqreain,0,/r/europe/comments/1kfh9r8/polish_opposition_presidential_candidate_nawrocki/mqrebap/
mqrdtdu,"**The European Union is set to unveil a long-awaited roadmap to completely phase out imports of Russian gas by 2027, as the bloc moves to end its energy dependence on Moscow.**  EU leaders pledged to cut reliance on Russian oil and gas after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, amid concerns that energy purchases were helping fund Russia’s military operations.      According to Bloomberg, Russia’s share of EU gas imports has already fallen from over 40% in 2022 to about 19% in 2024.      Nevertheless, the EU continues to rely on Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG), imports of which reached record levels last year.      Pipeline gas imports have also persisted despite the halt in flows through Ukraine on January 1, 2025, following the expiry of a transit agreement. In February 2025, the EU received 56 million cubic meters of gas per day via the TurkStream pipeline through the Balkans, an 11% increase from the previous month.  # Ending Russian imports an ‘absolute must’  In March, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen reaffirmed her commitment to phasing out Russian gas imports, calling it [“an absolute must.”](https://tvpworld.com/85500652/eu-committed-to-total-phase-out-of-russian-gas-von-der-leyen-says)      On Monday, European Commission spokesperson Stefan de Keersmaecker said that the EU will present a roadmap on Tuesday on how to wean itself off Russian energy.      “Tomorrow, the College will discuss a roadmap to end Russian energy imports,” he said, referring to the EU’s college of commissioners from the 27 EU countries.      Bloomberg, citing sources familiar with the plan, reported that the Commission will propose a ban on new gas deals and spot contracts with Russia starting in 2025.      At a later stage, existing long-term contracts would also be restricted, with the final ban expected to come into force by the end of 2027.  # EU looks to US for LNG  However, the commission’s timeline rests on the bloc’s ability to source alternative LNG supplies from the U.S., Qatar, Canada, and Africa, sources told Bloomberg.      Negotiations are underway with Washington to expand U.S. gas supplies to Europe as part of broader trade talks with Donald Trump’s administration.      The U.S. is already Europe’s largest supplier of LNG, and EU officials have shown interest in purchasing even more ultra-cold shipped fuel since Donald Trump returned to the White House.

mqremsd,"**First recognized in Poland as a national holiday in 1950, May 1 quickly became an instrument for communist propaganda with nationwide parades of diligent workers seemingly underscoring the popularity of the utopian society the authorities had built.**  This, however, was an elaborate illusion with the pomp and ceremony of the day masking the dull reality of life under Moscow’s yoke—unsurprisingly, as discontent with the regime grew, May 1 would become a platform for anti-government demonstrations.      That the date had been named a national holiday was, in itself, no great bombshell. In 1890, following an appeal issued the year before at the International Workers Congress in Paris, the day had been marked by demonstrations around the world calling for greater rights for the working class.      This global outpouring of grievances struck a chord with the masses, as well as socialist and communist groups, and May 1 was heralded by these factions as a day for the workers. In the interwar years, Poland’s socialist party would use May 1 to march around the capital protesting against the perils of capitalism.      With the post-war state’s compulsory adoption of communism, the idea of installing May 1 as a statutory holiday was rubber stamped on April 26, 1950, and thereafter it became a day defined by marches held across the country—the biggest, of course, being in Warsaw.  Whereas the additional day off work had been welcomed by many, it came with a caveat: a brooding pressure to participate in the parades that were held.      Although attendance was not officially mandatory, people were often bluntly cajoled into partaking by being promised financial inducements. Likewise, absentees would find themselves threatened with financial penalties or, even, the loss of their job.      Winding down Marszałkowska Street before concluding at the Palace of Culture and Science—where the First Secretary would deliver a stirring speech to the party faithful—these parades would see thousands bussed into Warsaw to take part in carefully orchestrated parades.      Little was left to chance, with close attention paid even to the size of the portraits that were carried aloft by the crowds—for example, pictures of Poland’s leader of the time, Bolesław Bierut, could not be larger than those of Stalin.      These earliest parades set a benchmark for what was to follow, with the marchers often sub-divided by profession—units of doctors would walk with their stethoscopes dangling over their white coats; miners in their helmets and overalls; engineers with their welding goggles; and fishermen carrying their nets.  “\[This\] was a spectacle designed on a grand scale,” historian Piotr Osęka told the Polish Press Agency. “The demonstrators used costumes, props, and gestures to indicate their profession. They played the role of a collective actor \[and\] created living allegories of ideological virtues and values.”      The sight would often lurch into bizarre, unexpected realms. “In the formalized and repetitive world of communist rituals, models and mock-ups, carried on trucks or carried by individual columns, provided an opportunity to show off inventiveness,” says Osęka.      “Female workers from confectionery factories carried huge cardboard bars of chocolate, power plant workers held models of steam turbines above their heads, and the builders of the Palace of Culture and Science carried a model of a building,” he adds.",1746473818.0,dat_9600gt_user,europe,t3_1kfh9p9,t3_1kfh9p9,1,/r/europe/comments/1kfh9p9/polands_may_day_through_the_years_a_story_of/mqremsd/
mqrenlu,"Adding to this odd-looking pageant, tractors, combine harvesters and bulldozers also rumbled down Marszałkowska in what was meant to be a powerful sign of the country’s advancement.  But despite the stage-managed nature of the day, it did not always go to plan—in 1949 (a year before it became a public holiday), May Day was impacted by a nationwide shortage of red cloth due to the overly-enthusiastic use of this material in previous years.      Then, in 1951, officials were left red-faced after portraits of Stalin, Bierut and Lenin were accompanied by slogans that declared: “Down with warmongers.” A few years later, part of the podium holding dignitaries collapsed, sending many party apparatchiks crashing to the ground.      Reflecting on the absurdities of May Day, the mathematician Hugo Steinhaus was scathing in his diary: “The firefighter’s ladder no longer leaves the University of Technology as it is constantly needed to hang or take down various flags and banners. No-one knows anymore if this is a celebration of peace, friendship, labor or some tragic buffoonery.”  Soon, the backlash would become more vocal. In 1966, a group of Warsaw students nicknamed ‘the commandos’ organized a demonstration on Defilad Square, right in front of the Palace of Culture and Science; two years later, more protests against communism would break out on this day, most famously (and violently) in Wrocław.      These outbreaks of dissent, however, were positively benign compared to what lay ahead. As Poland slid towards economic oblivion, and public unrest mounted, Martial Law was declared in December 1981.      With public gatherings of as little as five people often brutally suppressed, the Solidarity trade union—which had been at the forefront of previous anti-government protests—took the bold decision to announce mass demonstrations for May 1, 1982.  In Gdańsk, the home of Solidarity, between 3,000 and 4,000 activists marched to St. Mary’s Church; other protests broke out in Gdynia, Szczecin and Toruń. Then, there was Warsaw.      “The demonstration on May 1, 1982 was a huge dose of optimism for us, we saw our strength,” Jacek ‘Wiejski’ Górski, the co-founder of the Federation of Fighting Youth, told the Polish Press Agency. “The communists did not expect the opposition to take to the streets to celebrate the workers’ holiday, which the authorities had appropriated for themselves.”      Having first attended mass in Warsaw’s St. John’s Cathedral, anti-government demonstrators then took to the streets of Old Town where they met head-on with the ZOMO, Poland’s feared militia. Soon, running battles were taking place.      “The organizers of the demonstration assumed that the communists would not raise a hand against the workers on their holiday, but it turned out that this was unjustified optimism—the clubbing began in earnest, the water cannons were working at full speed, and tear gas was also used,” says Górski.  Undeterred by the brutality of this crackdown, anti-communist demonstrations continued to define May Day throughout the 1980s, with 1985 proving particularly bloody. In 1986, though, it was brains not brawn that won the day.      With Central and Eastern Europe reeling from news of the Chernobyl disaster, anti-communist activists used the catastrophe to call around party committees, erroneously telling them that the planned parades were being cancelled due to health concerns. Turnout at marches across the country was significantly reduced.      For Poland’s communists, the end was nearing, and in 1989 all planned marches were canned for the first time in history for fears that the newly-legalized Solidarity group would dominate the day.      When, soon after, the Iron Curtain fell, it ushered in a new era for Poland, and while May 1 remains a public holiday, its associations with the communist past have been thoroughly scrubbed out, and the sham parades of yesteryear are nothing but a curious memory.",1746473825.0,dat_9600gt_user,europe,t3_1kfh9p9,t1_mqremsd,1,/r/europe/comments/1kfh9p9/polands_may_day_through_the_years_a_story_of/mqrenlu/

mqre27w,"**Belarusian presidential candidate and activist Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya told TVP World that the democratic world needed to “shout loudly” for the opponents of Belarus’s pro-Moscow leadership.**  Tsikhanouskaya stood as a candidate in Belarus’s 2020 presidential election against President Alexander Lukashenko. After the election, she went into exile in Lithuania. She now heads the government-in-exile that opposes Lukashenko’s pro-Moscow rule.  Tsikhanouskaya told TVP World that political repression in Belarus is endemic. Every day in Belarus, she said, 10-15 people are detained for minor acts such as helping children of political prisoners, listening to Ukrainian songs, and reposting or liking something on the internet that shows solidarity with the opposition.  There are at least 1,200 political prisoners “who sacrificed their freedom for the fight for democracy in Belarus,” she added.  Tsikhanouskaya said that these people can be imprisoned for years on end and can face extremely harsh conditions, such as being denied medical care and the ability to communicate with the outside. She said some political prisoners have died in jail because of the authorities’ severe treatment.  “It's impossible \[for the opposition in Belarus\] to do something very visible” to resist Alexander Lukashenko’s regime, she said, which is why Tsikhanouskaya is calling on “the democratic world” to “shout loudly” about what's happening in Belarus.  “There will be no peace in the whole region until Belarus is free. Of course, victory for Ukraine is essential for us Belarusians. But sometimes I feel among democratic societies that they’re still thinking in ranks of spheres of influence, that ‘oh, Belarus is in the sphere of influence of Russia,’” she said.  # Belarus being sold to Russia   But Belarusians wanted to join the pro-European development path, Tsikhanouskaya said: “We want to be a sovereign, independent country... the same as Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and Armenia.”  Belarus needs “people who will contribute to \[their\] fight with moral support or with the support of the media or human rights defenders, or by providing the possibility of living in different countries for people who had to escape repressions.”  “Our state has been seized by a dictator who is selling our country to Russia, who is serving Russia, not Belarusian people... We want to achieve peace \[and\] freedom in Belarus, where our children are not afraid to speak up, and don’t have to live in an atmosphere of fear and repression,” said Tsikhanouskaya. ",1746473646.0,dat_9600gt_user,europe,t3_1kfh9og,t3_1kfh9og,9,/r/europe/comments/1kfh9og/no_fight_can_be_won_if_youre_alone_we_need_allies/mqre27w/

They’re strongly anti-abortion and anti-LGBT. The SLOVAKIA Movement is even more unpredictable. It’s a weird mix ranging from random anti-Fico people to ultra-religious fanatics. Matovič, who leads the party, is openly transphobic and is known for being chaotic. His last time in government was a disaster. He constantly blamed his own coalition partners for everything, which eventually led to SaS leaving and the government collapsing. At one point, he even tore up his resignation letter in front of the president’s secretary during a key confidence vote. SaS had made his resignation a condition for their support, and he just blew it up.  Right now, PS is working mostly with SaS, KDH, and sometimes the centrist Democrats. SaS is economically right-wing but socially liberal, so they’re a more stable partner. PS is also open to working with the Democrats, but they’re polling around 4.5%, which is just under the 5% needed to get into parliament.

mqqbuwb,"Article:  Like Donald Trump, the EU prides itself on its mastery of the art of the deal. The trademark Brussels event is a summit that ends at three in the morning, with weary negotiators emerging with a complex new accord.  The EU’s way of dealmaking is almost the precise opposite of the White House style. The US president is impulsive, fast-moving, makes extreme demands and is willing to break all the rules. The Europeans are legalistic, methodical and constantly looking for compromises and trade-offs.  The Trump style is flashier and makes for better headlines. The EU’s is deadly dull but much more effective.  The question of which kind of dealmaking — Brussels boredom or Mar-a-Lago mayhem — works better is more than a matter of pride. The future of the world economy could hang on it. Both the EU and the US are currently trying to come up with new trade deals. They also urgently need to settle their own differences before early July, when Trump’s 90-day pause on his “reciprocal” tariffs with the EU is scheduled to run out.  The EU-US trade relationship in goods is considerably larger than the flow between the US and China. And the transatlantic trade in services is also much more intense.  America’s tariffs on EU goods currently stand at 10 per cent. But they are set to rise to 20 per cent in July. The EU is also hit hard by America’s 25 per cent tariffs on cars, steel and aluminium, with the threat of further tariffs for pharmaceuticals.  With so much at stake, the European Commission is doing its utmost to de-dramatise its trade battle with the Trump administration — and to avoid turning it into an ideological struggle or a trial of strength.  But Brussels bureaucrats have found dealing with their Washington counterparts bewildering. One of the biggest problems is that it is unclear who in the Trump administration has any real authority to negotiate.  The Europeans are offering to buy more American produce, but they cannot accept permanent tariffs at the current levels. Some in Brussels fear that, come July, the Trump administration will simply extend the current regime for another 90 days of negotiating time.  At that point, the EU will have decisions to make. Does it finally retaliate and at what level? The general assumption is that the Europeans will feel compelled to hit back. The next question is whether retaliation will be restricted to trade in goods, where the EU has more to lose and its car industry is particularly vulnerable.  American tech companies are a much juicier target than manufacturers of Harley-Davidsons or Bourbon. But the Brussels mandarins also have to consider the possibility that the Trump administration would respond to tech sanctions asymmetrically by pulling US troops out of Europe. That would make Europe much more vulnerable to Russian aggression.  Given these unappealing options — and the unpredictability of the White House — the Europeans are doing what comes naturally: taking their time and moving cautiously. Just over a month has passed since Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs were announced and a huge amount has already changed. The one safe bet is that there will be a lot more turmoil over the next 60 days.  Like the Chinese, the Europeans are waiting to see if gaps start appearing on American supermarket shelves. They also know that potential tariffs on pharmaceuticals, while very painful for Europe, could spark a backlash in the US as essential medicines shoot up in price.  The best-case scenario for the Europeans is that the contradictions and self-harm in the Trump tariffs become increasingly evident in the run-up to July, leading to Europe being offered a much better deal than currently seems likely.  The European Commission is determined not to allow all its negotiating energy to be sucked up by a damage-limitation exercise with the US. One consequence of Trump’s global tariff war is that there is a significant increase in the countries that want to negotiate trade deals with the EU.  Piyush Goyal, the Indian trade minister, was in Brussels last week. A new accord is likely to be signed between the UK and the EU later this month — clearing away some of the most difficult issues left behind by Brexit. The United Arab Emirates opened free trade negotiations with the EU a few weeks ago. Trade talks with Australia, long stalled, have restarted. A deal with Latin America’s Mercosur bloc has already been agreed and awaits ratification. China is also keen to warm up trade relations with Brussels — although the Europeans will proceed cautiously there.  The countries that are beating a path to Brussels will find the EU slow moving and bureaucratic. A deal that Trump would aim to get over the line in weeks will take years to complete with the EU. On the other hand, as one Australian trade negotiator puts it: “The good thing about the EU is that if you do eventually do a deal with them, you know they’ll stick to it.”  The EU has already agreed roughly twice as many free trade agreements as the US and is well placed to conclude more. The Brussels art of the deal has its own peculiarities and frustrations. But it is considerably more serious and durable than the Trump version.",1746462521.0,DifusDofus,europe,t3_1kffuhc,t3_1kffuhc,16,/r/europe/comments/1kffuhc/why_the_eu_beats_trump_at_the_art_of_the_deal_the/mqqbuwb/

mqq26qp,">The European Union has rejected British appeals for access to critical crime and illegal migration databases as part of a Brexit reset with the bloc.  >In a blow to Downing Street’s attempts to improve security ties with Europe, Brussels has told UK negotiators the EU cannot share information, including the fingerprints of illegal migrants, with British police and immigration officials.  >Sir Keir Starmer had made improved access to data one of his central requests to the EU, saying: “[The] more we can share, the better.”  >However, Whitehall sources told The Times that in negotiations last week EU negotiators had made clear there could be no access to the Schengen Information System (SIS), which gives member states real-time alerts on criminal suspects.  >The UK will also not be able to use the EU’s fingerprinting system, Eurodac, that has a record of all illegal migrants caught trying to cross into the EU without permission.  >Regaining access to the database had been described as a potential “gamechanger” by Home Office officials, who are attempting to clear the record backlog of asylum claims and appeals. It would allow them to swiftly enable Home Office caseworkers to identify where an individual has previously applied for asylum and been rejected. Their case could then be fast-tracked and individuals prepared for removal.  >There are currently more than 38,000 migrants in hotels, costing taxpayers £5.5 million a day.  >One source close to the negotiations said there was “frustration” on the UK side that Brussels had so far rejected giving Britain access to the databases.  >“This is something that we would see as mutually beneficial but so far there has been no movement,” the source said. “The EU’s argument appears to be that it would set a precedent and that third parties can’t have access to Schengen databases. But it is frustrating, as it makes co-operation in areas like illegal migration much harder.”  >Another senior government negotiator described their commission counterparts as “intransigent” and “dogmatic” on data. “No matter how clear the mutual benefit, they’re not budging from the principle,” the negotiator said.  >A third source said the government was not seeking straight access or membership of SIS II or Eurodac but a “workaround” that would allow Britain and the EU to share key data and effectively replicate their functionality.  >However, the source said the EU was playing “hard” on any access.  >EU sources have long maintained that it is legally impossible to give the UK access to the databases as the country is no longer a member state or a member of the Schengen travel area, where people can move freely across borders without facing routine checks.  >Starmer has previously spoken about the importance of replicating the functionality of databases such as the SIS even if membership cannot be achieved, pointing to the real-time data and intelligence-sharing on criminal suspects it would give Britain’s law enforcement and security agencies.  >He told The Times last year: “I’m absolutely clear that when it comes to cross-border crime, particularly people smuggling, the more we can share the better. The more we can work together, the better. The more we know — whether, in this particular instance, people have claimed asylum in a previous country and something can be done about it — the better.”  >The impasse over data sharing is expected to make it harder to agree the principle of a youth mobility scheme at a summit on May 19 when details on the EU reset are unveiled. A senior government source said: “We are proceeding on the basis that it won’t happen because it can’t happen without at least some concession from the EU on data.”  >Instead, any agreement between the UK and EU is now likely to include only a commitment to explore a youth mobility scheme in future, despite growing expectations that a more detailed deal might have been reached.  >While the Treasury is pushing for British negotiators to soften their position, Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, has made clear her red lines are access to EU databases and a hard cap on the number of young Europeans admitted to Britain over a three-year period.  >A Downing Street source insisted that negotiations were continuing and that both sides were looking to find “innovative ways” for the EU to work within its legal framework while still sharing “as much information as possible” with the UK.  >Before Brexit, Britain had limited access to the SIS database because it was an EU member but not part of Schengen, as successive governments had opted out from surrendering border and asylum policy to Brussels.  >Despite years of haggling during Brexit negotiations, the legal and political barriers proved insurmountable because the move would require EU treaty change and were seen as “cherry picking”.  >A government spokesman said: “We are not providing a running commentary on our discussions with the EU. These are ongoing and cover a wide range of issues.
