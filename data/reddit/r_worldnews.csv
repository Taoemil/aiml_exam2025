mqujffe,"***The Telegraph reports:***  Britain is secretly preparing for a direct military attack by Russia amid fears that it [is not ready for war](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/03/01/britain-ukraine-russia-war-zelensky-putin-trump-starmer/).  Officials have been asked to update 20-year-old contingency plans that would put the country on a war footing after [threats of attack](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/09/21/putin-ally-threatens-london-nuclear-strike-alarming-interview/) by the Kremlin.  A classified dossier will set out how the Government would respond to a declaration of war, including bunkers to protect the Cabinet and the Royal family, public service broadcasts and the stockpiling of resources.  Ministers fear that Britain would not only be outgunned by Russia and its allies on the battlefield but would also be [unprepared and poorly defended](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/03/12/young-men-unprepared-to-fight-for-britain-says-lord-hammond/) at home.  Kremlin officials have repeatedly threatened the UK with a direct attack over its support for Ukraine, which may soon include [British troops on the ground](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/04/10/british-troops-could-be-deployed-in-ukraine-for-five-years/).  Experts have warned that the country is vulnerable to an assault on its critical [national infrastructure](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/12/03/russia-exploiting-uk-dependence-technology-gchq-destruction/), including gas terminals, undersea cables, nuclear power plants and transport hubs.  The Telegraph understands that an update to the classified “homeland defence plan” will set out a strategy for the days immediately after a strike on the UK mainland by a hostile foreign state.  It will include scenarios in which Britain is hit by conventional missiles, [nuclear warheads](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/29/russia-test-nuclear-missiles-land-sea-air-massive-response/) or cyber operations, which were a limited threat when the last significant update to the plan was made before 2005.  The plan, by the Cabinet Office’s Resilience Directorate, will direct the Prime Minister and Cabinet on how to run a wartime government and when they should seek shelter in the Downing Street bunker or outside London.  The war strategies for the rail and road networks, courts, postal system and phone lines are all expected to be examined. It is unlikely that the document will be released to the public for decades, if at all.  The Cabinet Office has already modelled a scenario in which a hostile state launched missiles and cyber attacks on national infrastructure at the same time.  A risk assessment, published in January, found that a successful attack was “likely to result in civilian fatalities as well as members of the emergency services”, cause serious economic damage and disrupt essential services.  ***Read more:*** [***https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/05/05/starmer-prepares-for-attack-by-russia/***](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/05/05/starmer-prepares-for-attack-by-russia/)",1746516425.0,TheTelegraph,worldnews,t3_1kfyljz,t3_1kfyljz,1,/r/worldnews/comments/1kfyljz/starmer_prepares_britain_for_attack_by_russia/mqujffe/

USA is no longer a preponderant power. China and Japan will sell US bonds if US warmongers keep up their scare campaign  The United States has not ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) despite participating in its drafting and subsequent modifications. The convention, which defines the rights and responsibilities of nations in their use of the world's oceans, came into force in 1994 and has been ratified by 168 countries and the European Union as of 2025.  The U.S. has recognized UNCLOS as a codification of customary international law but has not ratified it due to concerns over sovereignty and the potential for international lawsuits. Critics argue that joining UNCLOS would expose the U.S. to lawsuits, including those related to climate change, and would require the U.S. to pay royalties from oil and gas production on its extended continental shelf to an international body.  The United States is no longer the unchallenged global leader it once was, with its influence waning in various arenas such as conflict mediation and trust among traditional allies. The rise of challengers like China and the increasing autonomy of nations in the Global South has indicated the shift towards a multipolar world order where the U.S. is no longer the sole dominant power  This shift is evident in the diminishing ability of the US to project power and influence globally so the US must adapt to a multipolar world by trying to foster global relationships and developing processes and platforms to align interests and incentives to serve people.

mqug9el,"I’ve been studying war for over 25 years. I’d say the chances are higher, but it’s not going to look how it did in the first two wars. China will do everything in its ability to not cause significant disturbance in its economy, and frankly, too many countries rely on China and China knows it. Early Capitalist countries (America, England, Scandinavia, Canada etc) taught everyone for 70 years that you need to go where the money is. Now, China is where that money is and has been that way since the 90’s, but it began as early as the 70’s. China will likely do everything it can to prevent that production loss. Every major capitalist company on the entire planet either offloads their production or workforce to China or India because it’s the most profitable for the least amount of operational capital.   That being said, if India decides to dam or divert the Indus River it would all but destroy 80% or more of Pakistani food production. In the unlikely event that this happens, this war could absolutely lead to a nuclear war as Pakistani leadership, as well as the sheer number of extremist organizations they’ve harboured, is currently more likely to take drastic measures. Yes, even more than Trump or Putin. Regardless of how this hypothetical event plays out in reality, the war would likely spill into Russian, or Chinese territory.  How either nation would react to this is very, very challenging to predict. Time vs scale vs cost would be the primary logistical obstacles for a 3rd party nation to determine. By the time a “world war” scales up from this, the need for nukes would be drastically different than the decisions required would initially have suggested.   Nuclear war in Europe is extremely unlikely, and barring extreme ineptitude of intelligence, no western nation would launch a nuke unless the stakes were existential. If the various nations start destroying satellites, everything I said goes out the window. Mass paranoia would become the new king and that could absolutely lead to false flags.   Side note: who would even want to survive a nuclear war? Your best hope is to be nuked directly, because a global nuclear winter would cause a foot thick sheet of ice that blocked the entire planet for 1-10 years. Nothing would survive, and it would be a slow, cold, a dreadful end. There’s no hunting. No gathering. No food. Just cancer, disease, and death.   Anyway. I’d say it’s about 15%. The west relies heavily on U.S. intelligence. Since the U.S. has made enemies out of most nations, we’re about to enter a period where western intelligence is less reliable without the U.S., and that lack of reliable intel can lead to the aforementioned false flags.   Even if it was only a 1% chance, that still a very significant chance of it happening, which in itself is a horrifying concept.",1746514422.0,bongblaster420,worldnews,t3_1kfwqrh,t1_mqu8bh4,1,/r/worldnews/comments/1kfwqrh/many_in_us_and_western_europe_think_third_world/mqug9el/

mqugnxu,"It’s important to note that this document was produced under Tulsi Gabbard.   As someone who’s been studying geopolitics and force projection for decades, this report is horrifying in its misrepresentation of capabilities. A lot of what it says is true, but what it leaves out is mystifying bordering on maliciousness.   As but one example, it talks about Russian capabilities, with the Russian Air Force being more capable now than it was at the start of the war with Ukraine. This is laughably false. Russia has lost or had damaged hundreds of aircraft, including some its very limited AWACs.   As another example, it talks about degraded land fighting capabilities, and barely mentions the enormous challenges Russia is facing with heavy equipment manufacturing, and loss rate. It leaves out that Ukraine’s deteriorating position has been accelerated by the actions of the current administration. It talks about Russian missile capabilities while ignoring the fact that Russia’s effectively used up the entirety of its stockpile of long range missiles. It talks about heightened chance of nuclear war based on… vibes?   If this is the intel trump is getting on Russia, assuming he’s going off more than his own hubris-inspired beliefs, well then it’s no wonder he’s making these bone-headed moves.   The scariest thing about this report, frankly, is that it comes to the exact wrong conclusion about the war in Ukraine. It posits that protracted war with Ukraine increases risk to the US, which is precisely what Putin hopes we’ll believe. The truth is that if the west allows Russia to take large swathes of Ukraine, then the material wealth of the region and its population will allow Russia to rebuild its forces much more quickly, while simultaneously weakening NATO and giving Putin reason to believe he can do this all again.   Mark my words - the surest path to WWIII, in reality, is allowing Russia unimpeded access to pushing in Ukraine. That is almost guaranteed to result in a massive new war in 5-10 years’ time. Meanwhile, if we continue to help Ukraine fight off Russia, eventually the Russian economy and military will collapse as a statistical certainty.

We had over 500 atmospheric tests, and the whole US nuclear arsenal is ""just"" over 10 times that, so basically if there was no climate impact because of the testing, I doubt there would be such a catastrophic climate impact in case of war, at least not as bleak as stated in the article.    Radiation wise, famine and mass starvation due to disruption of agriculture and logistic chains, small and larger local conventional wars following the nuclear one... well that is a total different story, than the one depicted in your article, and the effects of it may be felt for centuries if not millenia afterwards. ",1746513850.0,sysmimas,worldnews,t3_1kfwqrh,t1_mquaf41,1,/r/worldnews/comments/1kfwqrh/many_in_us_and_western_europe_think_third_world/mqufbpi/

Also, what most westerners keep forgetting is that russians are quite resilient people who can starve but be happy with their 'great motherland' illusion. Most allies think that russians are similar to them but they are very wrong about it.   Their war economy cannot run in the long term and sooner or later sanctions would do their purpose however russians are gambling on western weakness. They are winning an information and propaganda war. They managed to put their people in american administration that managed to shut down all Trump critics in the Republican party. AfD did very well in Germany, Le Penn's buddy is the most popular candidate in the French presidential elections and Reform did win the local elections in UK last week. Not to mention Hungary, Slovakia and seems Romania, countries that not long ago were the victims of russian expansionism. If another conflict breaks out in another middle eastern country or even current indian and pakistani tensions escalates, I'm sure russians will use this in their advance. This will generate huge numbers of refugees and where they all will go? In this case russia would use their agents and useful idiots on both political spectrum to create a huge dissatisfaction in local communities. Leftists will promote letting them in and shout very loudly about their human rights violations in their countries. They would use such words like fascist, white privilege, racists, islamophobes etc in the meantime giving all the cards to populists' hands. And if in 4-5 years from now American leadership will remain in current administration hands while having pro russian people in power at least in 2 of 3 - Britain, France and Germany, who is going to help Ukraine or Baltics? If Ukraine falls and their army is incorporated into russian army, then they could easily conquer much more than they had during cold war.

mqu3ij3,"Adding to these - The treaty is specifically for 6 rivers shared between India and Pakistan.  Out of which 3 rivers are Glacial rivers while other 3 are partially glacial and seasonal rains.   Glacial river waters consist of 80% of the water share while the remaining 20% water comes from the other 3 rivers.   Now according to the treaty, Pakistan has control over water usage of these glacial rivers. While India cannot and only uses the seasonal rivers. Most agree,  since at the time of the treaty,  population in the Northern part of India there was quite less hence India allowed it to happen that way but as per current times India wants to use waters from the glacial rivers as well.  Also, India accuses Pakistan of wasting the water  resources by simply allowing excess water to mix with the sea. Many say this happens because Pakistan did not have inadequate storage or containment structures for water usage.  Currently, Before the suspension of the treaty, Pakistan was facing nearly 20% water shortage.

mquhd86,"a ton of studios in Ontario, Quebec, and BC do service work for American film and animation productions. Also tons of American productions use Canadian cities to film. It would be a major hit to the industry. I say this as a canadian who has worked on content for pbs kids before in an Ontario based studio (which also has been defunded).  The industry is already suffering from the hollywood writer strike from last year and also with Ai. There has been tons of layoffs across the board over the last 2 years. I believe quebec alone has laid off at least more than 50% of their VFX workers since last year.

mqtxu2w,"You don't seem understand how the tax incentives actually work or what they do. We aren't just firing free money at production companies. It is tax credits that are mostly on labour costs, meaning they get a break (not fully) on how much tax they need to remit in payroll. But in order to get these credits, these companies are still spending their production budgets here which collectively is billions of dollars being injected into our local economies on an annual basis. The most recent numbers I could find on Statistics Canada was $10.4B in 2023. The tax credits just provide an incentivize and give productions a bang for their buck so to speak.    This employs thousands of Canadians with good, skilled, well paying jobs. Those wages are then subject to income tax (the production gets a break on their side of payroll remittance, but individuals are still taxed normally). Then that income is of course spent throughout the economy, which is also taxed at every transaction, and that spending contributes to the businesses on the receiving end, who then employ people, who are then taxed, etc...   But that's only the labour. The rest of the film production budget is still spent throughout countless ancillary businesses which support the film industry. For example like gear rentals, heavy equipment rentals, location rentals, film permits, food, custom fabrication, set dressing, building materials, paint, fuel, you name it! Of course plenty of these businesses operate outside of the film industry as well. But I wonder, do you think they enjoy the additional, often massive, windfalls in revenue from selling their goods and services to film productions? And do you think this contributes to more employment? Again those businesses get paid and pay corporate tax, their employees get paid and pay income tax, then they spend their money, etc... Also with every transaction for goods and services rendered from vendors have applicable sales tax as well.   It's an important industry, and worth going to bat for. You'd be surprised how much is filmed in Canada. It really is hard to quantify the net benefit that the tax credits provide, because the benefit is diffused throughout the economy, but there certainly is a large return on investment.   As for siphoning away American productions... Those are often projects that can't be filmed in various places in America due to available locations. Not everything can be filmed inside a studio. It depends on the production itself, the setting of the script and story. The willingness of specific locales to be friendly to disruptions that filming can cause. There can also be budgetary constraints. The lower Canadian dollar helps stretch budgets, lower costs in general too. Without Canada's film ""service"" industry, some films would simply not get made because the risk-to-reward isn't there if it costs xx% more to do it in LA or NY.",1746504742.0,catsaysmrau,worldnews,t3_1kftjkt,t1_mqtoz5w,11,/r/worldnews/comments/1kftjkt/ontario_will_suit_up_to_fight_against_possible/mqtxu2w/

mqt2oxh,"From the note:  BHP Group’s joint-venture partner Lundin Mining Corp declared that the companies’ Filo del Sol project in South America to be the largest discovery of copper in three decades, based on new drilling and analysis.  The undeveloped mine contains at least 13 million tons of the metal, as well as significant amounts of gold and silver, Lundin said in a statement on Sunday. Drilling is ongoing, and the deposit’s estimated size is increasing, it said.  Copper mines are getting harder and much more costly to develop, even as global demand for the metal is projected to increase given its role in the energy transition. That outlook has prompted a wave of mergers in the industry, as well as forecasts for persistent deficits — and higher prices — in the future.  The initial so-called mineral resource “has highlighted the potential for one of the highest grade undeveloped open-pit copper projects in the world, and one of the largest gold and silver resources globally,” Chief Executive Officer Jack Lundin said.   BHP acquired Filo Corp in a US$3-billion deal last year, in partnership with Lundin, to gain ownership of two copper projects known as Filo del Sol and Josemaría, which straddle the Argentina-Chile border.

mqtuz3a,"There are already a lot of comments so no idea if mine will obtain any traction.  But here are some thoughts which I hope are worthy:  * This comment is positioning by the US govt to the world, but in particular MAGA that while they ""might hope for the best"" in respect of negotiations with Canada they want to set low expectations just in case. * The Trump admin is again attempting to feed the flailing narrative that Canada has been feeding off America for decades.  Unless truly you are so stupid as to not have 2 functioning brain synapses you know this is a false narrative.   But Trump& Co have to try to push the narrative to support their negotiating stance. * Lutnick is smart enough to know that Canada is not a socialist country and never has been.  It is a liberal philosophy based society that has had past governance from center-left and center right parties - but never a socialist party - especially in the meaning of EU or Russian/Chinese type socialism.    There is a quasi-socialist national party which has never held power and at this time has only 7 of 343 seats (2%) in their national parliament.   Lutnick uttering this statement about socialists is pure disinformation and just on its own that he said such sets out his own lack of character. * Trump has made some statements about ""liking"" Carney and not concerned that the Conservative party in Canada lost the national election last week.  This is pure malarky.  Had the Conservatives won the tenor of negotiations and likely outcomes would likely have been far more favorable for America. * Instead they got the worst outcome possible:  the world's leading practical economist Mark Carney who is battle proven in financial contexts (only person to ever be Governor of 2 different central banks and both were in times of crisis) and is known to be a very tough, skilled negotiator.   And who is leaps and bounds more knowledgeable in every aspect of economics (Dr of Economics from Oxford) and finance then any Trump team member, and really all of the Trump team combined.  So Lutnicks statements are setting the stage for anticipated lack of results beyond platitudes and agreements to continue negotiating.    Carney has already set the stage in Canada for it to continue some degree of economic disentanglement from America.  He has stated he wishes to continue a relationship with America but the terms are forever changed from the historical friendly relationship of the last 80 yrs.    Carney is already talking to allies about forming new like minded groups and he has a lot of ears paying attention as he has high credibility and deep relationships around the globe.  Canada have very deep friendly relations with at least a hundred countries and they are starting to work them.
