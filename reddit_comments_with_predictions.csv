The authors argue that in the course of the pandemic, “Suppression of scientific debate and the marginalization of dissenting voices weakened public trust in medical institutions.” They note the importance of physician-scientists being able to express dissenting and alternative views on pressing medical questions, maintaining that “suppressing alternative perspectives can lead to flawed policies that are difficult to reverse.” They conclude with a call for social media companies to prioritize free speech and to avoid “the temptation to censor,” building on the foundational free society principle that “the public should be trusted to assess information.”",1746475077.0,HooverInstitution,conservative,t3_1kfl92t,t3_1kfl92t,3,/r/Conservative/comments/1kfl92t/physician_autonomy_and_free_speech_essential_for/mqrixju/,0,0,0,0,0,0

mqpqgc6,"Just over five years ago, I renewed my California driver's license using the state's DMV website. A question popped up about whether I wanted a Real ID or state ID. I chose the Real ID. I didn't receive any other instructions at all apart that I could print out the temporary ID and receipt.   So, I brought that to the local DMV (along with all necessary paperwork). I stood in the long lines (normal for California) and waited four hours to speak with the DMV rep -- only to be told that their ""system isn't ready yet."" They said that their system wouldn't even recognize that I chose a ""Real ID"" (despite my receipt and paperwork) because there were ""issues"" in the system. They advised me to make an appointment for a Real ID and return another day.  Prior to my last birthday, I needed to renew my license again. Again, I selected the ""Real ID."" I was given an appointment date and instructions of what to bring. I showed up to the appointment (which still requires a wait time of a couple of hours in the Bay Area/Silicon Valley DMVs). However, this time, they stated that I had waited too long to bring in my paperwork.   I told them that I only selected the first available appointment during checkout (via the DMV website). The DMV worker said, ""Oh. Yeah, it's not a good website."" He then said that their system wasn't working properly. He advised me to make another appointment over the phone or at the desk (which would require waiting in line for two hours to them be sent to the appropriate counter). So, I left. I was mailed the non-Real ID.   Now, I will have to go through this hassle and pay for another license and hope for the best.   A Real ID shouldn't be so difficult to obtain. I suppose that it isn't so problematic in most states as it is in California -- particularly areas like the Silicon Valley.

I wish more people would study the history of this conflict more deeply, because the more you learn about it, the more appalling it is for the US to be funding it. Netanyahu's government had the funding, knowledge, and means to fully prevent what happened, and instead they chose to not only tolerate the continued existence of Hamas, but *support Hamas* to further their own political gain, and now the Israeli people, Palestinian people, and US taxpayers are all paying the price. All to further the political ambitions and agenda of a small group of people who definitely don't have their own citizens' best interests at heart.  We need to stop seeing this conflict as Israel vs. Palestine and start seeing it for what it is: Netanyahu's Government and Hamas vs. the Israeli and Palestinian people, with US taxpayers being very gullible financial victims as well as unwitting accomplices in it.

Neither of these governments (if you can call Hamas a ""government"") are popular.  And full disclosure, I say this with Jewish roots and close friends and extended family who are Israelis and served in the IDF. This stuff is common knowledge but somehow evades heavy discussion in the mainstream US media for reasons that elude me.

mqp7wqh,"I am old enough to have witnessed firsthand a major shift in the health of Americans.  As a child in the 70's, obese children were rare.  Obese adults were also less common.   Diabetes was called Juvenile (Type I) and Adult Onset (Type II).   Type II, which is typically caused by diet, was unheard of in children.   When kids started getting fat, and getting ""Adult Onset Diabetes"", they had to stop calling it that.  The culprits, in my opinion:    1 - the reliance on process foods, which are convenient, highly palatable, yet deliver very little nutrition.  2 - the rapid increase in sugar consumption, largely driven by the FDA guidelines of ""low fat, no fat"" for health in the late 70's, early 80's.  Manufacturers took out fat, and replaced it with sugar (usually HFCS) to help maintain flavor and shelf life.  That's how we ended up with sugary breads and fat free yogurts with 18 grams of sugar.  We have to reverse this.  It's costing us trillions in healthcare costs, and it's literally killing people.  (Insert here my rant about giving children in public school chocolate milk every day.

A man whose family is banned from operating charities for stealing money from cancer patients, a man whose family is banned from academia for running a fake for-profit university, a man who has bankrupted 6 times including casinos, a man who has discriminated against minorities and even now sends American Citizens abroad with reckless abandon status known or unknown. Fascism is here, and his supporters religiously accept their current capitalistic persecution of down markets in favor of the promise of a future consisting of an all-white Amerikkka. You cannot stop fascism by protest or democratic means. To stop fascism is to go to war. It marches ever onward and must be stopped by bullets and shelling alone. The Nuremberg trials proved that the root of all evil is a lack of empathy, and this man and his voters are a lack of empathy in aggregate. Anyone who stands on the sidelines will forever be marked collaborators à la Vichy France, afraid of instigating furor of the führer in favor of the status quo.",1746499848.0,Improvcommodore,democrats,t3_1kfth9y,t3_1kfth9y,14,/r/democrats/comments/1kfth9y/kamala_harris_stuns_at_the_met_gala/mqtm6gs/,1,0,0,0,0,0

In step wars lore the color of the light saber is from the crystal that effectively chooses you based on who you are as a person   Rule of two.  “The origins and meaning of red lightsabers in Star Wars are deeply tied to power, aggression, and the unrelenting dominance of the Dark Side.   Red lightsabers are notorious in Star Wars as a weapon carried by the most villainous of characters, the Sith. These villains had one life purpose: to eliminate the Jedi Order and gain control as tyrants throughout the galaxy.  The Sith followed the rule of two , which dictated that there would be one master and one apprentice. The apprentice would cleanse themselves of all physical and mental shortcomings, in many cases being controlled by their master until their soul was broken. While this purpose uniformly united most Sith, there were many instances throughout history in which red lightsaber users, including Sith Lords, would stray from this common goal to pursue their own conquests.”  https://ultrasabers.com/holocron/what-is-the-meaning-of-the-red-lightsaber/?srsltid=AfmBOopcvpRNO8aTJgR9iWsd5ucDGOnRKtpqAH4Xpe7zBXlCrT_mWXlg",1746395045.0,Oceanbreeze871,democrats,t3_1keu1ck,t3_1keu1ck,9,/r/democrats/comments/1keu1ck/trumps_a_sack_of_sith/mqltqgp/,0,0,0,0,0,0

mquky7v,"I agree. Learning and settling the native language of the land is pre-requisite of integration.  Skilled researchers (and skilled labor even) may not want to push through this barrier, and that's why Europe is not the first choice of many skilled researchers.  This invitation wants to invite people to come and research, and instead of making it easy and help focus on research, the politics and implied (but understandable) requirement of integration will want them to divert major part of attention learning a language. It's a bad investment even from EU's PoV.  Not to mention the fear that other EU countries will follow the Dutch government and cut the funding anyway as the right in their countries keep gaining more votes.  Immigration and economic refugee is a separate can of worms. Italy profits from 'economic refugee' almost same as USA does. Most of the workers in farms are asylee whose labor is extracted at far cheaper rate, or in factories with exploitative rates, or in restaurants on out of sight jobs where they are overworked to hell. Italy is smart(er) enough to know that.  When the country votes in the openly facist party, is uneducated (among worst in Europe), it's not that businesses are liberal enough to hire internationals. It's most of the time exploitation of people who will do anything to live in a slightly better place and will do the job that was never going to be taken by natives anyway.  One can't complain that (1) Economic refugees are burden, (2) they take our jobs in the same breath. Italy, an agricultural, and old mechanical industry land, is profiting from 'economic' refugees.

mqsnuph,"From European point of view, Obama’s legacy is hard to praise. His push for a “reset” effectively legitimized Putin’s regime. His lack of response to the 2008 Russo-Georgian War signaled to Russia that its aggression would go largely unchecked. Early in his presidency, he abandoned missile defense plans in Poland and Czechia, suggesting that Eastern Europe was up for negotiation. He took no decisive action during the 2014 annexation of Crimea, issuing sanctions so mild they were largely symbolic. During his tenure, Russia repeatedly tested NATO’s resolve — in Ukraine, in Syria, and through a surge in cyberattacks.  His lofty speeches often clashed with his (in)actions. While he spoke of defending democracy and ensuring security, his foreign policy left alliances strained, European security weakened, and Russia increasingly emboldened. Putin, in particular, benefited from Obama’s approach, expanding Russia’s influence with minimal pushback.",1746487942.0,DontMemeAtMe,europe,t3_1kfggw3,t1_mqrzot0,8,/r/europe/comments/1kfggw3/zelensky_posing_for_a_photo_with_ukrainian/mqsnuph/,0,0,0,0,0,0

mqst0fr,Australia and New Zealand are colonised nations that have fucked off its native population from any real political power and while the more informed unaverage citizen may respect that line of history and culture of the native. Institutional power has fucked them off into irrelevancy.   Any leader of the native population in the past standing up against a colonial government would not have been celebrating or seen kindly by the history books in your curriculum. It goes against the dominant culture and legitimacy of your governments.  A niche example you brought up to undermine historical significance of consequence does not fit here. The irrelevance on native leaders in being recognised and awarded with the prize of recognition is not given the slightest amount of generosity from either society.   Incorrect?

mqrdxi5,"**Ukrainian soldiers joined a military parade in London as the U.K. marked 80 years since the Allies’ defeat of Nazi Germany.**  Eleven Ukrainians were among 1,300 people who marched through the heart of the British capital on a route stretching from Parliament to Buckingham Palace.      The Ukrainian forces, carrying the country’s bright blue-and-yellow flag, were greeted with applause by onlookers, including members of the royal family, the BBC reported      King Charles, Queen Camilla, and the Prince and Princess of Wales were among those in attendance.      British defense officials said that the Ukrainians’ presence in the parade was a symbol of support for Kyiv’s “continued fight for freedom against Russia’s unprovoked, illegal invasion.”      Speaking to the British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) ahead of the parade, Captain Andriy Khomyshin, military chaplain at the Lviv National Army Academy, said he was “proud” to participate.      “It’s a big honor to participate in this parade as a part of the free world, and to represent our nation, our fighting nation, our military, who are \[in\] the worst condition on the frontline, fighting for our freedom,” he said.      Monday’s official commemorations of VE Day in the British capital started with the chiming of the bells of Big Ben, the iconic clocktower at the British Houses of Parliament, and a reading of wartime leader Winston Churchill’s victory speech in 1945.      After the parade, crowds watched modern and historic military jets flying over Buckingham Palace, led by the RAF’s iconic Lancaster bomber.      Further events will be held in the U.K. later in the week, including a minute’s silence at midday on Thursday 8 May, VE Day in Britain.

A lot of troops that kept the USSR in the war in 1941-42 were troops released from the Far East, because they knew Japan weren't going to enter the war against the Soviets, because they were dealing with the UK and US.  3. A massive problem for the Germans was the need to get a reliable source of oil, not to mention all the other critical resources from the USSR. Well... if the US and UK hadn't been opposed to the Nazis, guess what? Germany would've been able to simply trade for the gas, manganese, chromium, etc... it needed.  4. The Lufftwaffe was being constantly pressured and drained by US and UK bombing. A full-force, concentrated Lufftwaffe would've given more victories, done even more material damage to the Red Army.  The USSR was very close to actual collapse. A few things changing would've changed the entire outcome. I've seen people do the math. If you take every single tank the USSR was capable of producing, it wouldn't have been enough. They would've run out of tanks before stopping the Nazis. They would've run out of trucks.

mqreain,"Opposition candidate Karol Nawrocki, one of the two favourites to win Poland’s upcoming presidential election, has denied any wrongdoing after it emerged that he owns a second apartment, having declared in a recent TV debate that he only has one.  He suggests that the story has been “blown out of proportion” by media hostile towards him and even that the state security services were involved in creating the scandal.  However, leading figures from the ruling coalition, including a deputy prime minister, have said that Nawrocki has serious questions to answer about the revelations and that the information revealed so far undermines his credibility as a potential president.    The controversy was sparked by remarks that Nawrocki, the candidate supported by the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS), made during [last week’s presidential debate](https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/04/29/presidential-candidate-reports-far-right-rival-to-prosecutors-for-antisemitic-remarks-during-tv-debate/), in which he expressed opposition to a proposed property tax.  He said that he would “defend” Poles against the tax and that he was “speaking on behalf of ordinary Poles, like me, who have one apartment”.  However, shortly afterwards, news website Onet reported that Nawrocki in fact owns two apartments: one, a three-room 60m² property in Gdańsk, where he lives with his family; the second, also in Gdańsk, a 28.5m² studio.  Onet noted that, while the larger apartment was bought by Nawrocki and his wife with a mortgage, the second was obtained by them in 2017 from a man named only as Jerzy Ż. Five years earlier, they had already signed a preliminary agreement for the property.    In response, Nawrocki’s campaign spokeswoman, Emilia Wierzbicki, issued a statement on Wednesday last week saying that Nawrocki had always included all of his properties in asset declarations he had made and that his family “does not receive any income from owning the property” in question.  She added that the apartment “is at the disposal of a person who, for many years… Karol Nawrocki was the only one caring for”.  On Sunday evening, ahead of a further article about the apartment due to be published by Onet on Monday, Wierzbicki released another statement outlining how “Nawrocki has been helping Jerzy, who is a disabled person living alone, for many years.”    “Karol Nawrocki gave Jerzy money to buy the apartment, which Jerzy promised to give to Nawrocki in exchange for the help he provided,” she added. “When Jerzy came into conflict with the law, he continued to ask Karol Nawrocki for help many times and always received it.”  Wierzbicki said that this support had continued even after Nawrocki became the owner of the apartment, which Jerzy Ż continued to use. “Karol Nawrocki never lived in this apartment, never rented it out, nor did he derive any financial benefit from it.”  “The use of \[this\] case to attack Karol Nawarocki proves that the security services are engaged in a dirty campaign,” wrote the spokeswoman. “We have received information that a group of people is working on this, whose goal is to provide information from Karol Nawrocki’s personal security forms to the media.”",1746473716.0,dat_9600gt_user,europe,t3_1kfh9r8,t3_1kfh9r8,0,/r/europe/comments/1kfh9r8/polish_opposition_presidential_candidate_nawrocki/mqreain/,0,0,0,0,0,0
mqrebap,"In her latest statement, Wierzbicki said that Nawrocki had lost contact with Jerzy Ż last year, when he was no longer able to locate him. In their article published today, Onet reported that this is because Jerzy Ż, aged 80, is now living in a state nursing home.  The website said that Nawrocki’s campaign had for days been refusing to respond to their journalists’ questions and that Wierzbicki’s statement on Sunday contained “many inaccuracies”.  Onet reported that the city of Gdańsk had been paying almost 100,000 zloty a year for Jerzy Ż’s care and that Nawrocki “does not contribute a penny”.    On Monday, Nawrocki himself then addressed the issue at a press conference. He said that he had been “taking care of an old, sick man who was my neighbour for years”.  Nawrocki confirmed that the situation “ultimately ended with me being the legal owner of the apartment, to which I do not have keys, because this man lived in this apartment and I did not derive any benefits from it”.  “If there is a legal possibility to publish my financial declaration, I will do it,” he added. When Nawrocki was asked why he did not contact the police when he was unable to find Jerzy Ż last year, he did not answer. Nor did he respond to questions asking how much he paid for the apartment.  Like Wierzbicki, Nawrocki suggested that the state security services were behind the story. “The Internal Security Agency (ABW) has joined the Polish institutions helping Rafal Trzaskowski,” said Nawrocki, referring to the candidate of Poland’s main ruling party, the centrist Civic Platform (PO).    Government figures, however, say that Nawrocki still has many questions to answer. They also claim that the details revealed so far indicate that Nawrocki is not fit to be president.  The fact that Nawrocki simply lost contact with Jerzy Ż “looks bad”, said deputy prime minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz. “Just as Nawrocki did not take care of Jerzy, as he had committed to do, he also will not take care of Poland \[if elected president\].”  “Lies, deceit, contempt, greed and heartlessness – and, for camouflage, covered with fake charity and care,” wrote education minister Barbara Nowacka. “Sound familiar? Yes!! Eight years of their \[PiS\] rule were like that too.”    Meanwhile, Anna-Maria Żukowska, head of the parliamentary caucus of The Left (Lewica), one of Poland’s ruling parties, said that Nawrocki’s claims he had not lived in or profited from the apartment are irrelevant given that ownership of it may have significantly increased his wealth.  She asked for further information on what terms the Nawrockis had bought the property. “And all this involving a disabled elderly person who, on top of that, fell into legal troubles (debts?), whose tragic situation you exploited, only to later check if he’s even alive once a year at Christmas.”  Nawrocki, who is president of the state Institute of National Remembrance (IPN), was named last year as the candidate PiS would support in the presidential elections. He is currently running second in the polls, behind Trzaskowski, the mayor of Warsaw.  In recent weeks Nawrocki has [significantly closed the polling gap to Trzaskowski](https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/05/01/whats-gone-wrong-for-polands-presidential-frontrunner-trzaskowski-four-theories/) ahead of the first round of the elections on 18 May.

mqrdtdu,"**The European Union is set to unveil a long-awaited roadmap to completely phase out imports of Russian gas by 2027, as the bloc moves to end its energy dependence on Moscow.**  EU leaders pledged to cut reliance on Russian oil and gas after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, amid concerns that energy purchases were helping fund Russia’s military operations.      According to Bloomberg, Russia’s share of EU gas imports has already fallen from over 40% in 2022 to about 19% in 2024.      Nevertheless, the EU continues to rely on Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG), imports of which reached record levels last year.      Pipeline gas imports have also persisted despite the halt in flows through Ukraine on January 1, 2025, following the expiry of a transit agreement. In February 2025, the EU received 56 million cubic meters of gas per day via the TurkStream pipeline through the Balkans, an 11% increase from the previous month.  # Ending Russian imports an ‘absolute must’  In March, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen reaffirmed her commitment to phasing out Russian gas imports, calling it [“an absolute must.”](https://tvpworld.com/85500652/eu-committed-to-total-phase-out-of-russian-gas-von-der-leyen-says)      On Monday, European Commission spokesperson Stefan de Keersmaecker said that the EU will present a roadmap on Tuesday on how to wean itself off Russian energy.      “Tomorrow, the College will discuss a roadmap to end Russian energy imports,” he said, referring to the EU’s college of commissioners from the 27 EU countries.      Bloomberg, citing sources familiar with the plan, reported that the Commission will propose a ban on new gas deals and spot contracts with Russia starting in 2025.      At a later stage, existing long-term contracts would also be restricted, with the final ban expected to come into force by the end of 2027.  # EU looks to US for LNG  However, the commission’s timeline rests on the bloc’s ability to source alternative LNG supplies from the U.S., Qatar, Canada, and Africa, sources told Bloomberg.      Negotiations are underway with Washington to expand U.S. gas supplies to Europe as part of broader trade talks with Donald Trump’s administration.      The U.S. is already Europe’s largest supplier of LNG, and EU officials have shown interest in purchasing even more ultra-cold shipped fuel since Donald Trump returned to the White House.

mqremsd,"**First recognized in Poland as a national holiday in 1950, May 1 quickly became an instrument for communist propaganda with nationwide parades of diligent workers seemingly underscoring the popularity of the utopian society the authorities had built.**  This, however, was an elaborate illusion with the pomp and ceremony of the day masking the dull reality of life under Moscow’s yoke—unsurprisingly, as discontent with the regime grew, May 1 would become a platform for anti-government demonstrations.      That the date had been named a national holiday was, in itself, no great bombshell. In 1890, following an appeal issued the year before at the International Workers Congress in Paris, the day had been marked by demonstrations around the world calling for greater rights for the working class.      This global outpouring of grievances struck a chord with the masses, as well as socialist and communist groups, and May 1 was heralded by these factions as a day for the workers. In the interwar years, Poland’s socialist party would use May 1 to march around the capital protesting against the perils of capitalism.      With the post-war state’s compulsory adoption of communism, the idea of installing May 1 as a statutory holiday was rubber stamped on April 26, 1950, and thereafter it became a day defined by marches held across the country—the biggest, of course, being in Warsaw.  Whereas the additional day off work had been welcomed by many, it came with a caveat: a brooding pressure to participate in the parades that were held.      Although attendance was not officially mandatory, people were often bluntly cajoled into partaking by being promised financial inducements. Likewise, absentees would find themselves threatened with financial penalties or, even, the loss of their job.      Winding down Marszałkowska Street before concluding at the Palace of Culture and Science—where the First Secretary would deliver a stirring speech to the party faithful—these parades would see thousands bussed into Warsaw to take part in carefully orchestrated parades.      Little was left to chance, with close attention paid even to the size of the portraits that were carried aloft by the crowds—for example, pictures of Poland’s leader of the time, Bolesław Bierut, could not be larger than those of Stalin.      These earliest parades set a benchmark for what was to follow, with the marchers often sub-divided by profession—units of doctors would walk with their stethoscopes dangling over their white coats; miners in their helmets and overalls; engineers with their welding goggles; and fishermen carrying their nets.  “\[This\] was a spectacle designed on a grand scale,” historian Piotr Osęka told the Polish Press Agency. “The demonstrators used costumes, props, and gestures to indicate their profession. They played the role of a collective actor \[and\] created living allegories of ideological virtues and values.”      The sight would often lurch into bizarre, unexpected realms. “In the formalized and repetitive world of communist rituals, models and mock-ups, carried on trucks or carried by individual columns, provided an opportunity to show off inventiveness,” says Osęka.      “Female workers from confectionery factories carried huge cardboard bars of chocolate, power plant workers held models of steam turbines above their heads, and the builders of the Palace of Culture and Science carried a model of a building,” he adds.",1746473818.0,dat_9600gt_user,europe,t3_1kfh9p9,t3_1kfh9p9,1,/r/europe/comments/1kfh9p9/polands_may_day_through_the_years_a_story_of/mqremsd/,0,0,0,0,0,0
mqrenlu,"Adding to this odd-looking pageant, tractors, combine harvesters and bulldozers also rumbled down Marszałkowska in what was meant to be a powerful sign of the country’s advancement.  But despite the stage-managed nature of the day, it did not always go to plan—in 1949 (a year before it became a public holiday), May Day was impacted by a nationwide shortage of red cloth due to the overly-enthusiastic use of this material in previous years.      Then, in 1951, officials were left red-faced after portraits of Stalin, Bierut and Lenin were accompanied by slogans that declared: “Down with warmongers.” A few years later, part of the podium holding dignitaries collapsed, sending many party apparatchiks crashing to the ground.      Reflecting on the absurdities of May Day, the mathematician Hugo Steinhaus was scathing in his diary: “The firefighter’s ladder no longer leaves the University of Technology as it is constantly needed to hang or take down various flags and banners. No-one knows anymore if this is a celebration of peace, friendship, labor or some tragic buffoonery.”  Soon, the backlash would become more vocal. In 1966, a group of Warsaw students nicknamed ‘the commandos’ organized a demonstration on Defilad Square, right in front of the Palace of Culture and Science; two years later, more protests against communism would break out on this day, most famously (and violently) in Wrocław.      These outbreaks of dissent, however, were positively benign compared to what lay ahead. As Poland slid towards economic oblivion, and public unrest mounted, Martial Law was declared in December 1981.      With public gatherings of as little as five people often brutally suppressed, the Solidarity trade union—which had been at the forefront of previous anti-government protests—took the bold decision to announce mass demonstrations for May 1, 1982.  In Gdańsk, the home of Solidarity, between 3,000 and 4,000 activists marched to St. Mary’s Church; other protests broke out in Gdynia, Szczecin and Toruń. Then, there was Warsaw.      “The demonstration on May 1, 1982 was a huge dose of optimism for us, we saw our strength,” Jacek ‘Wiejski’ Górski, the co-founder of the Federation of Fighting Youth, told the Polish Press Agency. “The communists did not expect the opposition to take to the streets to celebrate the workers’ holiday, which the authorities had appropriated for themselves.”      Having first attended mass in Warsaw’s St. John’s Cathedral, anti-government demonstrators then took to the streets of Old Town where they met head-on with the ZOMO, Poland’s feared militia. Soon, running battles were taking place.      “The organizers of the demonstration assumed that the communists would not raise a hand against the workers on their holiday, but it turned out that this was unjustified optimism—the clubbing began in earnest, the water cannons were working at full speed, and tear gas was also used,” says Górski.  Undeterred by the brutality of this crackdown, anti-communist demonstrations continued to define May Day throughout the 1980s, with 1985 proving particularly bloody. In 1986, though, it was brains not brawn that won the day.      With Central and Eastern Europe reeling from news of the Chernobyl disaster, anti-communist activists used the catastrophe to call around party committees, erroneously telling them that the planned parades were being cancelled due to health concerns. Turnout at marches across the country was significantly reduced.      For Poland’s communists, the end was nearing, and in 1989 all planned marches were canned for the first time in history for fears that the newly-legalized Solidarity group would dominate the day.      When, soon after, the Iron Curtain fell, it ushered in a new era for Poland, and while May 1 remains a public holiday, its associations with the communist past have been thoroughly scrubbed out, and the sham parades of yesteryear are nothing but a curious memory.",1746473825.0,dat_9600gt_user,europe,t3_1kfh9p9,t1_mqremsd,1,/r/europe/comments/1kfh9p9/polands_may_day_through_the_years_a_story_of/mqrenlu/,0,0,0,0,0,0

mqre27w,"**Belarusian presidential candidate and activist Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya told TVP World that the democratic world needed to “shout loudly” for the opponents of Belarus’s pro-Moscow leadership.**  Tsikhanouskaya stood as a candidate in Belarus’s 2020 presidential election against President Alexander Lukashenko. After the election, she went into exile in Lithuania. She now heads the government-in-exile that opposes Lukashenko’s pro-Moscow rule.  Tsikhanouskaya told TVP World that political repression in Belarus is endemic. Every day in Belarus, she said, 10-15 people are detained for minor acts such as helping children of political prisoners, listening to Ukrainian songs, and reposting or liking something on the internet that shows solidarity with the opposition.  There are at least 1,200 political prisoners “who sacrificed their freedom for the fight for democracy in Belarus,” she added.  Tsikhanouskaya said that these people can be imprisoned for years on end and can face extremely harsh conditions, such as being denied medical care and the ability to communicate with the outside. She said some political prisoners have died in jail because of the authorities’ severe treatment.  “It's impossible \[for the opposition in Belarus\] to do something very visible” to resist Alexander Lukashenko’s regime, she said, which is why Tsikhanouskaya is calling on “the democratic world” to “shout loudly” about what's happening in Belarus.  “There will be no peace in the whole region until Belarus is free. Of course, victory for Ukraine is essential for us Belarusians. But sometimes I feel among democratic societies that they’re still thinking in ranks of spheres of influence, that ‘oh, Belarus is in the sphere of influence of Russia,’” she said.  # Belarus being sold to Russia   But Belarusians wanted to join the pro-European development path, Tsikhanouskaya said: “We want to be a sovereign, independent country... the same as Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and Armenia.”  Belarus needs “people who will contribute to \[their\] fight with moral support or with the support of the media or human rights defenders, or by providing the possibility of living in different countries for people who had to escape repressions.”  “Our state has been seized by a dictator who is selling our country to Russia, who is serving Russia, not Belarusian people... We want to achieve peace \[and\] freedom in Belarus, where our children are not afraid to speak up, and don’t have to live in an atmosphere of fear and repression,” said Tsikhanouskaya. ",1746473646.0,dat_9600gt_user,europe,t3_1kfh9og,t3_1kfh9og,9,/r/europe/comments/1kfh9og/no_fight_can_be_won_if_youre_alone_we_need_allies/mqre27w/,0,0,0,0,0,0

There have already been several rebellious MPs, and Fico had to basically bribe them with minister positions to keep things together.

The biggest opposition party is Progressive Slovakia, but they would likely need to work with the Christian Democrats (KDH) and the SLOVAKIA Movement.  The Christian Democrats are very conservative. They’re strongly anti-abortion and anti-LGBT. The SLOVAKIA Movement is even more unpredictable. It’s a weird mix ranging from random anti-Fico people to ultra-religious fanatics. Matovič, who leads the party, is openly transphobic and is known for being chaotic. His last time in government was a disaster. He constantly blamed his own coalition partners for everything, which eventually led to SaS leaving and the government collapsing. At one point, he even tore up his resignation letter in front of the president’s secretary during a key confidence vote. SaS had made his resignation a condition for their support, and he just blew it up.  Right now, PS is working mostly with SaS, KDH, and sometimes the centrist Democrats. SaS is economically right-wing but socially liberal, so they’re a more stable partner. PS is also open to working with the Democrats, but they’re polling around 4.5%, which is just under the 5% needed to get into parliament.

mqqbuwb,"Article:  Like Donald Trump, the EU prides itself on its mastery of the art of the deal. The trademark Brussels event is a summit that ends at three in the morning, with weary negotiators emerging with a complex new accord.  The EU’s way of dealmaking is almost the precise opposite of the White House style. The US president is impulsive, fast-moving, makes extreme demands and is willing to break all the rules. The Europeans are legalistic, methodical and constantly looking for compromises and trade-offs.  The Trump style is flashier and makes for better headlines. The EU’s is deadly dull but much more effective.  The question of which kind of dealmaking — Brussels boredom or Mar-a-Lago mayhem — works better is more than a matter of pride. The future of the world economy could hang on it. Both the EU and the US are currently trying to come up with new trade deals. They also urgently need to settle their own differences before early July, when Trump’s 90-day pause on his “reciprocal” tariffs with the EU is scheduled to run out.  The EU-US trade relationship in goods is considerably larger than the flow between the US and China. And the transatlantic trade in services is also much more intense.  America’s tariffs on EU goods currently stand at 10 per cent. But they are set to rise to 20 per cent in July. The EU is also hit hard by America’s 25 per cent tariffs on cars, steel and aluminium, with the threat of further tariffs for pharmaceuticals.  With so much at stake, the European Commission is doing its utmost to de-dramatise its trade battle with the Trump administration — and to avoid turning it into an ideological struggle or a trial of strength.  But Brussels bureaucrats have found dealing with their Washington counterparts bewildering. One of the biggest problems is that it is unclear who in the Trump administration has any real authority to negotiate.  The Europeans are offering to buy more American produce, but they cannot accept permanent tariffs at the current levels. Some in Brussels fear that, come July, the Trump administration will simply extend the current regime for another 90 days of negotiating time.  At that point, the EU will have decisions to make. Does it finally retaliate and at what level? The general assumption is that the Europeans will feel compelled to hit back. The next question is whether retaliation will be restricted to trade in goods, where the EU has more to lose and its car industry is particularly vulnerable.  American tech companies are a much juicier target than manufacturers of Harley-Davidsons or Bourbon. But the Brussels mandarins also have to consider the possibility that the Trump administration would respond to tech sanctions asymmetrically by pulling US troops out of Europe. That would make Europe much more vulnerable to Russian aggression.  Given these unappealing options — and the unpredictability of the White House — the Europeans are doing what comes naturally: taking their time and moving cautiously. Just over a month has passed since Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs were announced and a huge amount has already changed. The one safe bet is that there will be a lot more turmoil over the next 60 days.  Like the Chinese, the Europeans are waiting to see if gaps start appearing on American supermarket shelves. They also know that potential tariffs on pharmaceuticals, while very painful for Europe, could spark a backlash in the US as essential medicines shoot up in price.  The best-case scenario for the Europeans is that the contradictions and self-harm in the Trump tariffs become increasingly evident in the run-up to July, leading to Europe being offered a much better deal than currently seems likely.  The European Commission is determined not to allow all its negotiating energy to be sucked up by a damage-limitation exercise with the US. One consequence of Trump’s global tariff war is that there is a significant increase in the countries that want to negotiate trade deals with the EU.  Piyush Goyal, the Indian trade minister, was in Brussels last week. A new accord is likely to be signed between the UK and the EU later this month — clearing away some of the most difficult issues left behind by Brexit. The United Arab Emirates opened free trade negotiations with the EU a few weeks ago. Trade talks with Australia, long stalled, have restarted. A deal with Latin America’s Mercosur bloc has already been agreed and awaits ratification. China is also keen to warm up trade relations with Brussels — although the Europeans will proceed cautiously there.  The countries that are beating a path to Brussels will find the EU slow moving and bureaucratic. A deal that Trump would aim to get over the line in weeks will take years to complete with the EU. On the other hand, as one Australian trade negotiator puts it: “The good thing about the EU is that if you do eventually do a deal with them, you know they’ll stick to it.”  The EU has already agreed roughly twice as many free trade agreements as the US and is well placed to conclude more. The Brussels art of the deal has its own peculiarities and frustrations. But it is considerably more serious and durable than the Trump version.",1746462521.0,DifusDofus,europe,t3_1kffuhc,t3_1kffuhc,16,/r/europe/comments/1kffuhc/why_the_eu_beats_trump_at_the_art_of_the_deal_the/mqqbuwb/,0,0,0,0,0,0

mqq26qp,">The European Union has rejected British appeals for access to critical crime and illegal migration databases as part of a Brexit reset with the bloc.  >In a blow to Downing Street’s attempts to improve security ties with Europe, Brussels has told UK negotiators the EU cannot share information, including the fingerprints of illegal migrants, with British police and immigration officials.  >Sir Keir Starmer had made improved access to data one of his central requests to the EU, saying: “[The] more we can share, the better.”  >However, Whitehall sources told The Times that in negotiations last week EU negotiators had made clear there could be no access to the Schengen Information System (SIS), which gives member states real-time alerts on criminal suspects.  >The UK will also not be able to use the EU’s fingerprinting system, Eurodac, that has a record of all illegal migrants caught trying to cross into the EU without permission.  >Regaining access to the database had been described as a potential “gamechanger” by Home Office officials, who are attempting to clear the record backlog of asylum claims and appeals. It would allow them to swiftly enable Home Office caseworkers to identify where an individual has previously applied for asylum and been rejected. Their case could then be fast-tracked and individuals prepared for removal.  >There are currently more than 38,000 migrants in hotels, costing taxpayers £5.5 million a day.  >One source close to the negotiations said there was “frustration” on the UK side that Brussels had so far rejected giving Britain access to the databases.  >“This is something that we would see as mutually beneficial but so far there has been no movement,” the source said. “The EU’s argument appears to be that it would set a precedent and that third parties can’t have access to Schengen databases. But it is frustrating, as it makes co-operation in areas like illegal migration much harder.”  >Another senior government negotiator described their commission counterparts as “intransigent” and “dogmatic” on data. “No matter how clear the mutual benefit, they’re not budging from the principle,” the negotiator said.  >A third source said the government was not seeking straight access or membership of SIS II or Eurodac but a “workaround” that would allow Britain and the EU to share key data and effectively replicate their functionality.  >However, the source said the EU was playing “hard” on any access.  >EU sources have long maintained that it is legally impossible to give the UK access to the databases as the country is no longer a member state or a member of the Schengen travel area, where people can move freely across borders without facing routine checks.  >Starmer has previously spoken about the importance of replicating the functionality of databases such as the SIS even if membership cannot be achieved, pointing to the real-time data and intelligence-sharing on criminal suspects it would give Britain’s law enforcement and security agencies.  >He told The Times last year: “I’m absolutely clear that when it comes to cross-border crime, particularly people smuggling, the more we can share the better. The more we can work together, the better. The more we know — whether, in this particular instance, people have claimed asylum in a previous country and something can be done about it — the better.”  >The impasse over data sharing is expected to make it harder to agree the principle of a youth mobility scheme at a summit on May 19 when details on the EU reset are unveiled. A senior government source said: “We are proceeding on the basis that it won’t happen because it can’t happen without at least some concession from the EU on data.”  >Instead, any agreement between the UK and EU is now likely to include only a commitment to explore a youth mobility scheme in future, despite growing expectations that a more detailed deal might have been reached.  >While the Treasury is pushing for British negotiators to soften their position, Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, has made clear her red lines are access to EU databases and a hard cap on the number of young Europeans admitted to Britain over a three-year period.  >A Downing Street source insisted that negotiations were continuing and that both sides were looking to find “innovative ways” for the EU to work within its legal framework while still sharing “as much information as possible” with the UK.  >Before Brexit, Britain had limited access to the SIS database because it was an EU member but not part of Schengen, as successive governments had opted out from surrendering border and asylum policy to Brussels.  >Despite years of haggling during Brexit negotiations, the legal and political barriers proved insurmountable because the move would require EU treaty change and were seen as “cherry picking”.  >A government spokesman said: “We are not providing a running commentary on our discussions with the EU.

Ben Seghir from Monaco if you fancy a high potential punt  Has Hudson Odoi had a better year than Martinelli? Ndiaye at Everton probably did.

mqsqh6g,You make a solid point. Some players just become scapegoats. But we need to look at what they're actually saying to properly judge if there's substance to what they're saying. Him being selfish and not passing are things that could be potential issues especially in our team. They also say he's raw so there's potential for improvement.    There's a chance under a new coach that he could curb those bad habits. But Martinelli has issues keeping his head up at times. He's gotten a bit better at it but it's still there. There's a chance Gittens won't be able to fix his own issues. He's a risk and an expensive one at that.  If Arteta can get rid of his bad habits we've got a potential 100m player. But if he can't then we're in trouble especially for the price BVB are quoting.   I trust the recruitment but it's crunch time now. No big title next season and we're going to struggle to keep some of our main guys. This summer window is a big one.

mqrqld6,"Arsenal should try to stifle PSG's rhythm, and I think that the best way to achieve that is to make the game be as scrappy as possible. A game that flows well favors PSG, as they can keep the ball for long periods of time and toy with you. A stop-start game prevents them from putting constant pressure and movement to try to break you down. How can Arsenal make the game scrappy? By making and forcing many fouls. Also by trying to make PSG fight for aerial duels, which is something that bothered PSG in the first leg. It felt that PSG was great at winning all but the aerial duels, and it felt that they became a lot more common as the game went on, breaking PSG's rhythm and allowing Arsenal to get control. Good pressing is also important. The more they have to hoof it long, the more we have of those aerial duels they struggle to win at, and the harder it becomes for them to get into their ideal rhythm. Arsenal should try its hardest to not let PSG get into the flow we saw from them in the matches against Liverpool and Villa in Paris, when the opposition could almost never break out of their own half, it was a pain to make even three passes in a row.  I don't think this is just the best strategy to deal with PSG, I think it's the best way to have a good chance against highly technical teams that put heavy emphasis on ball possession. Mourinho did this against Guardiola's Barcelona in the final of the 2011 Copa Del Rey, spoiling the treble for the best version of that Barcelona, even better than the one that actually won the treble in 2009. To be clear, I'm not saying this PSG team is anywhere near the level of that Barcelona.

mqrm665,"I read more about Gittens. Seems like Dortmund fans have concerns about his consistency. I mean, at 20 no one should be surprised that there are such issues unless you're a world class talent.   Although one thing that Gittens constantly provides is great dribbling. This season he is among the 10 players who completed most dribbles in Top 5 European leagues.  Btw also besides Doku, Gittens has played the least minutes so his per 90 numbers are even more promising:  Source: https://www.statmuse.com/fc/ask/most-dribbles-completed-this-season-europe-top-5-league  Imo, Arteta is looking for his own Doku, what I mean by that is Arteta wants a LW that can consistently beat his man in a low block, because that inevitably opens up space for others. Williams links confirm that in my eyes too, although he would be a very costly solution.   One the reasons for that is  we keep dropping points to teams that defend deep, because they know that besides Saka we don't have a player that can take a ball, beat defenders and force other defenders to commit.

mqr6ojz,"1 - We do have more than one creator in the team. Rice and Saka are both huge creators within the side, alongside Odegaard. The ""Odegaard is the only creator in the team"" narrative is only used by those who want to blame everything on Odegaard.  2 - Martinelli had a drop off last season, this season he has been better. But even in his current state, he is better than most LW wingers that people want us to sign. Martinelli may be weaker going forward than these LW players that people want, but he's miles better than all of them when it comes to working his bollocks off when we defend as a unit.

mqr181n,"Anyone we buy uses up transfer funds.   There's so much emotion in the arguments in this sub. People simply are not looking at things logically. Let's examine your position:  Is Isak realistic? Newcastle are probably thinking they could finish *above* us this season. Even if we win CL, it would be tough to tempt him into leaving, let alone get the club to sell since they're not short of cash and have a solid project themselves.  I don't know why everyone is so married to that pipe dream? You're making it sound like it's us who are choosing to not sign the player. And if it happens, we'd be smashing the transfer record by a lot to get him.  Aside from Isak, what other elite striker exists out there that would warrant a big money move? All the other targets being thrown around here are massive gambles in their own right: **Sesko**, **Gyokeres**. **Osimhen**, maybe, but he's not even in any conversations these days.  As for prem-ready players. It's unlikely we buy **Ollie Watkins**, and **Cunha** seems to be going elsewhere (or we're not interested). Who's left? **Semenyo**? **Mateta**? **Mbuemo** (not a striker, but let's go with it). That's it for PL-proven strikers that would be a realistic targets.   Which of those gets you excited? If Isak is your dream, then I'm sure you'd be underwhelmed with the alternatives.  That said, personally, I'd take any 2 of Cunha, Mateta and Mbuemo. 100-120 would do it and they could cover multiple spots along the front 3. I'd be happy with those signings, but I'd never bet on them happening.  The market for quality attackers is thin. For strikers it's next to nothing. There's just none: Madrid doesn't really have one (Mbappe is Mbappe, though). Barcelona is fielding a geriatric (who was having one of his best seasons, notwithstanding); Munich paid €100m for a 30yo Harry Kane just to win the Bundesliga... which they usually win anyway. PSG doesn't have an actual striker. Even AC Milan had Olivier Giroud starting for them as recently as last season. If I was a Manchester United fan who saw Cantona, Cole + Yorke, van Nistelrooy, Rooney, Ronaldo and van Persie play, I'd be weeping at what I'm having to watch these days. And they've always been able to make big money purchases.  I was a football fan at a time when all of the above teams had Ballon d'or, CL and WC winners starting for them within the same era. The current market is shit.  So, to get back to the point. Saying 100m for Rodrygo is too much is fine in isolation. But you cannot frame it as if there's all these elite strikers who are realistic targets just waiting to be bought, and we're not looking at them.",1746469830.0,chrisd1680,gunners,t3_1keekv3,t1_mqoz41t,1,/r/Gunners/comments/1keekv3/revelo_real_madrid_are_contemplating_the_sale_of/mqr181n/,0,0,0,0,0,0

Because Havertz has almost always been our highest receiver, people assume he's a passenger because they see him passing back all the time - but that's not Havertz's fault, it's not like he can do anything else from those positions.  If we shifted mountains to get Havertz on the ball with his head up towards goal like we do for Odegaard, you'd have a very different perspective on the player.  I'm not saying we have to do that, I'm just explaining the contextual differences - you cannot assess players without first accounting for context.  You also have to consider that the deeper controlling stuff Odegaard does is going to be parasitized by Zubimendi anyway.  Havertz being unable to do that stuff would be irrelevant in that setup because that's not what his role would be.",1746466225.0,MasterBeeble,gunners,t3_1kf65lb,t1_mqqelk0,2,/r/Gunners/comments/1kf65lb/may_05_2025_daily_discussion_transfers_thread/mqqoprc/,0,0,0,0,0,0

This doesn't mean all players in Portugal are bad, but it's really hard to judge them by an abstract output like goals scored. I remember Núñez had 2.7 successful dribbles per game with Benfica. I thought, ""Oh, his technique must be decent,"" but we know the truth now; his successful dribbles per game in the EPL are almost zero. I'm not saying Gyökeres is the same as Núñez, but the point here is that abstract data hardly gives us correct information.  And second, scoring goals is a big part of a striker's life. But with the context that Salah is still our main focus for at least another year, and Slot has said many times he wants his striker to act like a number 10 on many occasions, I think we will focus a lot on how good he is with the ball, how good he is in make play, and also in passing.

And a lot of his goal highlights has plenty of shitty defending from the opposition.   I'm not worried about his ability to score goals, he looks a fantastic finisher and a good fit for how we create chances.

But there’s still always the question of fit and the question of how much stronger is the prem than the Portuguese league, which I find hard to quantify (as do you you noted.)  I also currently really like Isak and this doesn’t change that though his injuries are a worry for sure. I’m sad that this data makes Ekitike look so bad as well as he was my other favorite, but I think that’s inevitable when for a quarter of this data’s time he was barely playing or getting used to a new club at 20. A useful reminder he’s only had one, maybe one and a half TOP seasons but that’s something I already knew and I like him anyways.  Also, obviously, some of this data is biased by the player’s teams. I particularly find Alvarez’s Att Touches p/90 to not really be indicative of him as a player but more of an ultra defensive Simeone style and a Pep style where the striker is much less involved in buildup than years past.

mqud4gr,"Joao Pedro for me please. The link up play with Mo will be awesome.   He does everything and I feel he’s underrated because he’s playing the false nine and works more to facilitate his teammates. Dribbles and drives forward like a champ, passes like a playmaker, moves around like a busy bee, scores goals, does flicks and trick, takes pens and free kicks. He has a huge frame and long strides.  As a 9 in this system I think he would be absolutely fantastic. Players around him would benefit greatly from his presence, more so than Darwin and Jota. Main issue is availability but this can be improved in house.   It’s clear the way Slot has used his 9’s that he likes them to participate in the build up. I don’t think Gyo or Sesko or the likes have the technical skills and passing range to do that at the highest of levels. I also don’t think he’s going for poacher type Isak vibe because he rarely used Darwin this way.",1746512535.0,Unlucky-Meaning-4956,liverpoolfc,t3_1kfvplg,t3_1kfvplg,2,/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1kfvplg/evaluating_potential_center_forwards_or_how_i/mqud4gr/,0,0,0,0,0,0

mqt2q5r,"I know there's almost a tribalistic urge to really hate on Trent right now, and from a fan perspective it does make sense to be critical of him leaving us when we're in a very good place and he's had the opportunity to win it all with his boyhood club. I was genuinely hoping against hope that he'd somehow stay even though the writing was on the wall for a long time now, and a large part of me is still frustrated that he couldn't show the power of loyalty over anything, as others have done before him, though those kinds of character traits and decisions don't come as easily in the environment of modern football, I suppose.  All that being said, I think many fans are just taking the vitriol too far with the Trent erasure. He was an absolutely vital part of all our success these last seven or eight years, and despite some disappointment in his attitude at times, I think he honestly loves the club through thick and thin. Klopp leaving and the allure of Real were blows that couldn't negate his potential inclinations to stay, and I understand that he wants to diversify his experience as a footballer in another context, with the largest club on the planet to boot. I don't think that takes away from everything he did with us, for us, and as part of the team. He won everything. and became a world class player doing so, a uniquely brilliant passer with many iconic moments to remember.  So I am sad and a bit disappointed personally, yes, but I refuse to act like we should slag Trent and purge him from all the great moments and legacies he helped create. He was utterly instrumental in so much of what we experienced as fans, so a level of dignity and appreciation should be maintained, even amidst the bothersome and harsh reality of how he is leaving us. He did everything with us, and that is worthy of respect. I wish him all the best (unless Real play us, then I hope he gets torched and we smash them), and he will always hold a special place in my heart as a fan along with all the other Klopp-era greats we have had from 2019 onwards. He's a part of our history, keep the damn mural! We can be upset, but let's also be proud of his achievements with us, not bitter about his decision now.

Regarding the transfer fee, how does it show a lack of respect? He’s still put in a ton of effort and done a lot for the club. Additionally, it is probably true that Real Madrid was unwilling to pay any sort of substantial fee, meaning that Trent would have never gotten the move in the first place if he had held out for a transfer fee.  Finally, add on the fact that the club (maybe) could have offered him more, or extended his contract far sooner… And while the idea of wanting a “new challenge” may not be the most accurate, I can totally see it being stale for a player who’s grown up and lived his entire life in Liverpool, to want to try living in a new city/country - hell, I’m currently working on moving to a new place right now, just for a change.",1746502120.0,TheLordPapaya,liverpoolfc,t3_1kfoktd,t1_mqt8vjk,-2,/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1kfoktd/im_gonna_need_some_updates_on_what_happens_to/mqtrstp/,0,0,0,0,0,0

I wish we had got money for Trent too but we never had to spend a fee to purchase him in the first place.  Contrast with Macallister at Brighton or Coutinho with us, both of them were acquired for a fee, so maybe genuinely felt more responsibility to get the clubs some of their transfer money back (or turn a profit).   We definitely invested money in Trent over the past 20 years but only because he could help us win more. No fee was ever paid for him, he never topped the club’s list of earners, so idk that he necessarily “owes” us anything.

Trent is choosing to guarantee safety by locking in a salary at ages 30-32, versus potentially making more by ending his contract at age 30. Depends on your risk tolerance, either way is a solid way to go. There's a world where Trent drops off before age 30. He's protecting himself from that. Obviously the flip side would be that he's still elite at 30 and suddenly he cost himself an extra year or two of premium salary if he had a 4 year contract.

That said, one thing that has really pissed me off about him the last couple of years is how lackadaisical he became for large stretches.

mqtig2t,"I'm really struggling with how to feel about Trent right now. As a relatively older Liverpool fan—old enough to have seen glimpses of Barnes and Rush, Fowler, Owen, Macca, and of course Gerrard and Carra—I’ve seen generations of legends come and go. In recent years, few players have had the kind of impact on the new Liverpool era that Trent Alexander-Arnold has had.  To my nine-year-old niece and nephew, Trent is Liverpool. They’ve grown up knowing and loving football through him. My younger brother, with whom I've built a lifelong bond through Liverpool and football, is Trent’s biggest fan. And for me, for quite some time, Trent was one of the best players in the world—essential to our identity as a club.  Liverpool Football Club, and especially this era under Klopp, got me—and I’m sure many others—through some of the darkest times. It helped me cope during the pandemic, helped me through the loss of my father, through losing my job, through depression. Trent was part of that. So were Bobby, Sadio, Gini, Origi, Virg, Mo, and Ali. These players weren’t just footballers; they were lifelines. So no—I can't hate him. I love him. But I also feel completely betrayed.  He’s leaving for the worst possible club. A club that arguably cost us three more Champions League titles. A club whose players once injured one of ours so badly, it changed the course of a final. A club that represents everything we despise about modern football. And he’s going there on a free transfer.  He’s leaving his boyhood club, his home, the memories—everything—for our biggest rivals.

It hurts because he chose to leave for Real Madrid, a club that is fucking annoying and our constant rival while Trent has played for us.  But it doesnt hurt any more because of a lack of transfer fee - or at least it doesnt make me any more angry. We are massively underfunded by FSG vs our competitors and while that stays the case I wont support their balance sheet particularly.  He probably did the right thing for his family, he'll get paid probably 4+ seasons pay in a signing bonus vs what he was on for us. And then will earn more there per season. The fundamental issue is transfer fees and how large they are vs player salaries.  We should absolutely be using similar tactics to Real Madrid and using our EPL & recent UCL win to trumpet us as one of the best places to come and play football/win trophies/be part of something huge. The problem is that the cheaters massively overpay for whatever scraps are left over after RM/Barca take their pick.

mqr1jyt,"According to our editorial team, VfB Stuttgart midfielder Angelo Stiller has become a major focus of Liverpool FC. The Anfield Reds have signaled serious interest in signing the German international this summer. Dutch head coach Arne Slot's team secured the 20th English title in the club's history just eight days ago.  Liverpool are now thoroughly considering their squad structure for the coming season, in which Stiller is expected to become a key new element in central midfield. The 23-year-old, who joined Stuttgart from TSG Hoffenheim in the summer of 2023, only extended his contract with VfB Stuttgart until 2028 in January.  But the offer from northern England is likely to be financially significant. The €60 million mark is the threshold beyond which even those in charge in Stuttgart, including CEO Alexander Wehrle and sporting director Fabian Wohlgemuth, are likely to start pondering, despite Stiller's importance for VfB's game. But the message from England is clear: Liverpool want to pry Stiller away from VfB Stuttgart if possible. Just as they did with former captain Wataru Endo in 2023, who hasn't established himself as a regular at Anfield with only 18 short Premier League appearances. Endo, already 32, cost around €20 million at the time. Stiller, 23, is now expected to fetch three times that. Meanwhile, rumors that left-back Maximilian Mittelstädt was considering a move to SSC Napoli have been false. Several Italian media outlets had reported this. The 28-year-old did indeed recently visit the city on Mount Vesuvius, but the rumored meeting with SSC sporting director Giovanni Manna never took place. Rather, Mittelstädt was in Naples on a personal trip.",1746469929.0,HaidarSaad,liverpoolfc,t3_1kfj2s5,t3_1kfj2s5,56,/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1kfj2s5/liverpool_fc_is_seriously_interested_in_angelo/mqr1jyt/,0,0,0,0,0,0

mqud3ox,"> It is possible that Mr. Trump had “Escape From Alcatraz” on his mind when he declared on social media on Sunday that he had directed federal agencies to rebuild and reopen Alcatraz to serve as “a symbol of Law, Order, and JUSTICE.”  > When he was asked on Monday how he came up with the idea, he said that he should have been a “moviemaker,” and he praised the island’s top-notch security.  > “Nobody ever escaped,” he said, not quite accurately. “One person almost got there, but they — as you know the story — they found his clothing rather badly ripped up. It was a lot of shark bites, a lot of problems.”  > In “Escape From Alcatraz,” shreds of the material of a raincoat are found floating in the bay.  The idiot watched a movie and let it inform his policy decisions... What a fucking clown.  But let's also not pretend like he isn't trying to follow in Bukele's footsteps here. Even though this type of project would be extremely costly, impractical, inhumane, and would amount to a massive logistical nightmare, this is just another attempt from Trump to appeal to his seething and mindless followers with more ""law and order,"" ""tough on crime"" dog whistling.  Alcatraz was abandoned for a reason. It's literally a ruin at this point. They've actually had to reinforce areas of the prison to prevent concrete from falling on the heads of tourists.  Its buildings are missing roofs and entire walls, there's no sewage system or running water, and the government pronounced it a crumbling ""relic"" over 60 years ago when they closed it down.  Alcatraz was also deemed insolvent, costly and ""insufficient"" to house prisoners. Rebuilding and maintaining it is just impractical from a mere economic perspective.  But now Trump wants to restore this relic because he watched a movie recently and he's more interested in rallying his base into a frenzy over more promises of ""crime and punishment"" and imprisoning ""undesirables.""  In all likelihood, Trump won't be able to follow through on yet another absurd proposal, but that hasn't stopped his supporters from demanding that Trump's political opponents be the first to grace its cells.  I bet Trump's also thinking that he can use Alcatraz as a Bukele-like ""terrorist containment center"" where he can incarcerate so-called migrant ""gang members"" and ""criminals,"" as well as foreign students, protestors, journalists and political dissidents with little to no due process.

mqu0mk4,"(excerpts from article)   The House Judiciary Committee’s portion of major spending legislation includes a provision that appears to limit the authority of judges to find U.S. government officials in contempt of court, drawing fire from critics who say it amounts to freeing the Trump administration to ignore court orders  The measure, Section 70303, is the final paragraph of 116 pages of text the committee approved last week as part of the process detailed in the fiscal 2025 budget resolution.  The language would prohibit courts from using federal funds to enforce a contempt citation for failing to comply with court orders if plaintiffs don’t offer money for bond pursuant to the rules of civil procedure — something experts said does not happen in most cases challenging U.S. government policies.  A House Judiciary Committee aide said the provision is meant “basically to stop frivolous lawsuits.”  Democrats say the language would have a profound impact on the authority of the courts at a time when the Trump administration has expressed hostility towards judges for issuing orders against his policy initiatives.  At least two federal judges — Judge James E. Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and Judge Paula Xinis of the U.S. District Court of Maryland — have suggested they might find Trump administration officials in contempt of court in immigration-related cases.  At the markup of the text last Wednesday, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, top Democrat on the committee, said the proposal “seeks to strip the courts of their power to hold an administration in contempt when the president violates explicit judicial court orders.”",1746505967.0,Nerd-19958,politics,t3_1kfw11q,t3_1kfw11q,1,/r/politics/comments/1kfw11q/gop_aims_at_contempt_of_court_in_house/mqu0mk4/,0,0,0,0,0,0

mqtx2xz,"As per [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/cory-mills-florida-bronze-star-iraq-b2745118.html) 📰:  - Representative Cory Mills earned his Bronze Star for reportedly saving his fellow soldiers in Iraq, but those present say they don’t remember the lawmaker being there.   Representative Cory Mills, a MAGA Republican from Florida, was awarded a Bronze Star for his heroism in Iraq in 2003 — but those he allegedly saved don’t remember him being there, a new report reveals.  Mills was honored after he administered “life-saving care” to fellow soldiers Joe Heit and Alan Babin at “great risk to his own life” while under “intense enemy fire” in Iraq, NOTUS reports, citing the document recommending Mills receive the award. Mills enlisted in the Army in July 1999 at 19 years old and was honorably discharged in August 2003.  But Heit told NOTUS that Mills “didn’t save” his life, and that he didn’t even suffer life-threatening injuries.  “I don’t recall him being there either,” he added.  Henry Barbe, a medic who flew in via helicopter to help evacuate Babin, also told NOTUS he doesn’t remember Mills being there.  “From what I understand about Mills is he might have been in the unit. I don’t remember him being involved in the medevac,” Barbe said. “To be fair, I was worried about the patients. I don’t remember him, and from what I understand, other people don’t remember him.”  Chris Painter, the platoon sergeant, said he can “pretty much confirm 100% Cory Mills was not up at the bridges at the location of everything.”  “Now, if he came to the company position to assist in escorting Babin to the BN aid station, I don’t know...but he wasn’t at the bridge [where] it all happened I do know that,” Painter told NOTUS.  Army documents recommending Mills for the award also state he saved Joe Ferrand, a sergeant who had been “grabbed by an enemy insurgent” in a separate incident, according to NOTUS. But Ferrand previously claimed Mills’ involvement in the incident was a “fabrication” and said that the act “never took place,” in a written statement to government officials.  In response to these claims, Mills told NOTUS that “no soldier writes their own DA Form 638,” referring to the document used to recommend soldiers for awards.  “It is a recommendation for award and soldiers cannot recommend themselves,” Mills said. “The form must be reviewed and signed by commanding officers.”  Mills also conceded that it was “true” that Heit “did not have life-threatening injuries” and attributed the discrepancies to how chaotic the day was.  “I was on the ground,” Mills said. “It was a chaotic day and understandable that others may have different recollections of events.”  The questions around his Bronze Star have been relayed to the Office of Congressional Ethics, Department of Justice, a U.S. attorney’s office in Florida and the FBI, the source told NOTUS.  This isn’t the first time Mills’s military accomplishments have been questioned.  Last year, Mills’s Republican challenger Michael Johnson handed out flyers accusing him of lying about his military service and committing stolen valor, The Daytona Beach News-Journal reports. Mills denied the claims at the time.  “I’m tired of the slander and the defamation,” Mills told the News-Journal. “I ran for office to be able to serve the American people, not to defend something I did 20 years ago over and over and over.”  Mills was elected to Congress in 2022 and has since proven a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump. Mills even attended his hush money trial last summer alongside fellow lawmakers including Speaker of the House Mike Johnson and Representative Byron Donalds.  The Republican lawmaker also made headlines February after his romantic partner Sarah Raviani filed a police report claiming she had been assaulted by Mills at his Washington, D.C. apartment.  “(Her significant other for over a year) grabbed her, shoved her, and pushed her out of the door,” the police report obtained by NBC Washington states.  Raviani, a cofounder of the group Iranians for Trump, then allowed police to listen in on a phone call between her and the congressman in which he allegedly instructed her to “lie about the origin of her bruises.”  Mills “vehemently denies any wrongdoing whatsoever.”  The Independent has contacted Mills’s office for comment.",1746504402.0,T_Shurt,politics,t3_1kfvlfm,t3_1kfvlfm,1,/r/politics/comments/1kfvlfm/gop_rep_was_awarded_a_bronze_star_for_his_bravery/mqtx2xz/,0,0,0,0,0,0

mqtyyiy,"Per chatgpt:  Reestablishing Alcatraz Island as a modern supermax prison for 500 inmates would be a massive and logistically complex project. Here's a rough cost estimate broken into major components:   ---  1. Demolition of Existing Structures  Full teardown of the deteriorated historic prison and other non-salvageable facilities (environmentally sensitive process due to protected status): $100–150 million (Includes asbestos abatement, environmental protections, and work by marine contractors.)    ---  2. Island Stabilization and Infrastructure Upgrades  Foundation work, erosion control, island stabilization: $75–100 million  Utility infrastructure (power, water desalination, wastewater treatment, HVAC, and fire suppression): $150–200 million    ---  3. Construction of Modern Supermax Facility  500-inmate supermax prison built to ADX Florence standards (~$700K–$1M per bed, higher due to remote location): $350–500 million  Includes security tech, isolation cells, reinforced structures, air/water filtration, etc.    ---  4. Transportation Infrastructure (Off-Island and Marine)  Dedicated ferry system and dock improvements, emergency evacuation infrastructure, maintenance barge systems: $75–100 million    ---  5. Staff Housing and Support Facilities (On or Near Island)  If housing is built on the island (likely necessary for 24/7 staffing): $100–150 million (Housing, commissary, clinic, recreation for ~300–400 staff.)    ---  6. Security and Communications Infrastructure  Encrypted comms, surveillance, maritime radar perimeter, drone defense, etc.: $50–75 million    ---  7. Permitting, Environmental Compliance, Legal, and Public Engagement  Alcatraz is a National Historic Landmark and part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, requiring extensive NEPA, NHPA, and California Coastal Commission compliance: $50–100 million    ---  8.

mqtrmor,"From the article:  A federal judge ordered the North Carolina Board of Elections on Monday to certify the results of the state’s Supreme Court election, giving Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs the upper hand in the still-contested race.  Chief U.S. District Judge Richard E. Myers ruled Monday that the state board must certify the results of the November election, which have been the target of legal challenges by Republican Judge Jefferson Griffin.  Last month, the state’s Supreme Court mandated that the majority of the contested ballots be counted in the race. In a 4-2 ruling, the state’s high court determined that ballots containing missing information, including Social Security numbers, from legal voters were still valid.  “Under this Court’s longstanding precedent, mistakes made by negligent election officials in registering citizens who are otherwise eligible to vote will not deprive the citizens of their right to vote or render their vote void after they have been cast,” North Carolina’s Supreme Court previously said.  Myers’s Monday ruling stated the ballots challenged by Griffin should be counted, stating the “retroactive invalidation of absentee ballots cast by overseas military and civilian voters violates those voters’ substantive due process rights.”  Griffin has seven days to appeal before the order takes effect.  “This consolidated action concerns an attempt to change the rules of the game after it had been played,” Myers wrote of Griffin’s challenges in the 68-page ruling.",1746502047.0,kootles10,politics,t3_1kfuxj3,t3_1kfuxj3,1,/r/politics/comments/1kfuxj3/federal_judge_orders_nc_to_certify_state_supreme/mqtrmor/,0,0,0,0,0,0

mqu7h3q,"The fundamental problem is that Democrats don't know how to talk to people, and (perhaps more importantly) don't know how to sympathize with people. Democrats do a poor job acknowledging people's pain.   Democrats will often do a whole big song and dance that basically goes ""I don't understand what the big deal is, here's a series of facts explaining why your feelings are wrong.""   In the case of the economy for example, your average Democrat leader will say things like, ""What are you talking about? The economy is great! Look at the stock market! Look at the unemployment rate! Look at the GDP!"" It does nothing to acknowledge their pain and suffering, and essentially makes them look crazy.  All of those metrics are worthless if you are working two jobs and are still struggling to make ends meet.   This is something the Republicans do very well, but only for the wrong reason. They will say, ""We feel you. The economy is terrible, and it's because of the Democrat's weak border policy and influx of illegal immigrants. If we win, we will deport all of them which will improve the cost of living.""   Republicans validate emotions, blame some marginalized group, and claim to be able to fix it.   Bernie Sanders (and AOC to some degree) is able to do this well. If you listen to him talk about the economy, he essentially starts by saying ""the economy is rigged against you, your pain is valid"" and then blames the appropriate parties (corporate greed, big money in politics) and proposes policy solutions to fix it.",1746509364.0,walkallover1991,politics,t3_1kftxfi,t1_mqu3308,1,/r/politics/comments/1kftxfi/axios_senate_democrats_have_invited_new_york/mqu7h3q/,0,0,0,0,0,0

mqu8ybe,"We’ve been steeped in individualism for too long. Too many folks are busy “putting on their own oxygen masks” (so to speak).  When the country was new, and even partway through last century, parents had a much higher chance of outliving one or more of their kids. It wasn’t any more pleasant than now, but at least in the backs of their minds they were surely aware that it might happen.  Comparatively, broadly speaking, parents of today seemingly go to great lengths to make sure their kids are far safer, more prepared, and better informed than the generation that birthed them. I infer that a lot of folks don’t plan on endangering what they have... be it their lives, property, or offspring.  “Giving unto Caesar while turning the other cheek and avoiding judging, envying, or aspiring to hoard wealth“ is also a plausible factor.

mqu2mll,It’s a dog whistle. An old one at that since no one really respect IQ tests they way they used too.

mqtavzh,"Here is the beginning of the story:  Following online outrage from the right, the House canceled a planned vote on the [IGO Anti-Boycott Act](https://jewishinsider.com/2023/05/mike-lawler-josh-gottheimer-bds-anti-boycott-law/), legislation expanding current U.S. anti-boycott laws to include international organizations, despite broad bipartisan support for the legislation last year.  The fallout is just one recent example of how actors on the political fringes have mobilized to stymie pro-Israel legislation and bills to combat antisemitism that otherwise enjoy bipartisan support — often by misrepresenting their aims and impacts — and have ammassed sufficient influence to upend that bipartisan consensus and scuttle the legislative process.  The bill expands [current U.S. anti-boycott laws](https://jewishinsider.com/2022/10/commerce-department-arab-league-israel-boycott-american-jewish-committee/) first passed in the 1970s, primarily as a counter to the Arab League’s boycott of Israel. [Additional authorities](https://www.congress.gov/115/plaws/publ232/PLAW-115publ232.pdf) and guidelines were passed into law in 2018 under President Donald Trump. The existing law imposes penalties for companies or individuals which comply with or facilitate compulsory foreign boycotts of U.S. allies as a condition of doing business in foreign countries.   The new law would apply to potential boycott policies enforced by international organizations like the United Nations or European Union.  Bipartisan support for identical legislation last year was so strong that it passed the House by a voice vote in February 2024, after being [reported out of the House Foreign Affairs Committee by a 42-3 vote](https://jewishinsider.com/2023/12/house-foreign-affairs-committee-anti-boycott-laws-human-shields-terrorists/) in late 2023. But this year, it’s meeting a very different reception.  The legislation as written does not ban or criminalize boycotts of Israel by U.S. citizens or companies undertaken outside of compulsory policies by international organizations, nor does it punish Americans who do not purchase Israeli goods. Current law specifically states that “the mere absence of a business relationship” in the boycotted country is not sufficient evidence of a boycott under the law. But some on the right took to X on Sunday to claim otherwise.",1746495836.0,jewish_insider,politics,t3_1kfsyi1,t3_1kfsyi1,1,/r/politics/comments/1kfsyi1/house_cancels_vote_on_igo_antiboycott_act/mqtavzh/,0,0,0,0,0,0

mqti10v,"First, let’s get some facts straight (please be objective here).  El Salvador had a brutal civil war during the 1980s meant to prevent the spread of communism, and it was supported by the US. Out of those communists came out the political party known as FMLN, which is a Socialist party. After the war, most Conservatives fled the country giving FMLN a majority. Some of them were corrupt, giving FMLN a bad name. But FMLN is an inclusive party. Bukele’s family is actually from Palestine, but his family moved to El Salvador and were able to build massive wealth with ownership in media companies. Long story short, Bukele would never be allowed in Conservative parties so he went to FMLN.   This allowed him to become mayor of its most populous city. He had tried his whole agenda of economic revitalization there but failed badly. As mayor, he tried to solve the gang problem by establishing a truce between gangs. Most Americans have no idea why this is so bad, but it’s a terrible move. In Mexico, one politician tried a truce between cartels, but this truce was unknown to the public, and it was the drug cartels who exposed this politician for letting drug cartels run their shady business as long as it was kept away from the public(so still executions and kidnappings, but complete media blackout). Basically, Bukele is telling the gangs that he will give them complete media blackout as long as they obey when he tells them to stay away from the issues hethat affect him. This would mean that gang members execute people deep inside the jungle where no one will ever know about it.   Long story short, this gang member had a media personality and it allowed politicians to use it when they needed political bonus points. Now this gang member was able to flee and is in some other country exposing Bukele. And this hurts him because it shows that he is willing to let gang members do what they want so long as it benefits him ",1746498321.0,JollyToby0220,politics,t3_1kfsxuy,t1_mqtaz3b,1,/r/politics/comments/1kfsxuy/trump_ally_bukele_reportedly_set_to_arrest/mqti10v/,0,0,0,0,0,0

mqt8he3,"🥨 The Convergence of Political Influence and Financial Enterprise.       Donald Trump's political influence and financial ventures- Including MAGA Inc., Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), Truth Social, DJT stock, and the $TRUMP and $MELANIA cryptocurrencies illustrate a complex ecosystem where political capital is leveraged for financial gain.         This convergence raises significant ethical concerns and potential avenues for exploitation in both political and financial arenas.           -----------------   MAGA Inc.: Political Fundraising with Financial Implications.       MAGA Inc. serves as a super PAC supporting Donald Trump's political campaigns.       While its primary function is political fundraising, the PAC's activities can indirectly influence Trump's financial ventures.         For instance, heightened political activity and media coverage can drive user engagement on platforms like Truth Social, potentially boosting the value of associated stocks and cryptocurrencies.       This symbiotic relationship blurs the lines between political advocacy and financial profiteering.        ---------------------   🗞 Trump Media & Technology Group and Truth Social: Merging Politics with Business.       TMTG, the parent company of Truth Social, exemplifies the fusion of political branding with commercial enterprise.      After merging with Digital World Acquisition Corp., TMTG went public under the ticker DJT. Trump holds a significant stake in the company, valued at approximately $4.6 billion.         The platform's user base and engagement levels are closely tied to Trump's political prominence, making the company's financial performance susceptible to political events.       This intertwining raises concerns about the use of political office to drive personal financial gain.            --------------------   🪙 $TRUMP and $MELANIA Coins: Cryptocurrencies with Political Overtones.        The launch of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins introduced a new dimension to the monetization of political identity.      These cryptocurrencies experienced significant volatility, with $TRUMP reaching a market capitalization of $7.5 billion shortly after launch.      However, the coins have been criticized for their speculative nature and potential conflicts of interest, especially given Trump's role in shaping cryptocurrency policy.         Ethics experts have raised concerns about the possibility of these coins being used to circumvent campaign finance laws or as vehicles for foreign entities to gain influence.        ---------------------   🪙 Token Performance Snapshot:        $TRUMP:       Launch Price: ~$10.      Peak Price: $74.59.       Current: ~$11.21.      Decline: ~85%        $MELANIA:        Peak Price: $13.73.       Current: ~$0.33.      Decline: ~97.6%        These steep drops reinforce concerns about volatility, speculation, and potential manipulation in politically branded crypto assets.        ---------------------   🍽 Mar-a-Lago: Monetizing Access to Political Power   Recent reports indicate that business leaders are paying substantial sums up to $5 million for one-on-one meetings and $1 million for group dinners-to dine with President Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate.       These events, organized by MAGA Inc., blur the lines between political fundraising and personal enrichment.       The lack of transparency regarding the allocation of these funds and the potential for policy influence raises serious ethical and constitutional concerns, particularly in relation to the Emoluments Clause.          ----------------------   💰 Foundations and Financial Misconduct: A Pattern of Self-Dealing.       Investigations into the Eric Trump Foundation and the Donald J. Trump Foundation have revealed troubling patterns of financial misconduct, including potential charity fraud and tax evasion.       The Eric Trump Foundation claimed to use Trump Organization golf courses free of charge for fundraising events, but financial records and eyewitness accounts show that the charity was billed over $1.2 million- much of it paid directly to Trump-owned businesses.        Experts noted that the costs, such as a $322,000 charge for a single event, far exceeded reasonable market rates, indicating self-dealing and deceptive donor practices.       Similarly, the Donald J. Trump Foundation repeatedly used charitable funds for personal expenses, such as buying Trump portraits and making political contributions, clear violations of nonprofit laws.       While establishing criminal intent is challenging, the documented behavior suggests a misuse of charitable organizations for personal enrichment that merits legal scrutiny.         ------------------   Asset Management and Conflict of Interest:       While Trump's assets are nominally held in a revocable trust managed by his son, this arrangement does little to resolve concerns about conflicts of interest.      The structure enables Trump to benefit indirectly from policy decisions that affect his holdings- particularly in emerging sectors like cryptocurrency.        Legal scholars have also raised Emoluments Clause concerns, especially regarding potential foreign investment in Trump-affiliated businesses, which could be interpreted as constitutionally impermissible.        --------------",1746495016.0,Ok-Amphibian3164,politics,t3_1kfs1q7,t3_1kfs1q7,1,/r/politics/comments/1kfs1q7/trumps_meme_coin_business_racks_up_fees_as_buyers/mqt8he3/,0,0,0,0,0,0

mqtkrx6,"I'm not sure if ""No True Scotsman"" is the way out of this.  From libertarianism.org  > When ordinary people aren’t careful to respect their neighbors’ privacy, or presume to boss other people about or physically interfere with them, those of us concerned with justice and civility object. We might say: “Stop that. Mind your own business.” But the agents of the state act like the same rules don’t apply to them. Once they decide they want to do a thing, they generally don’t stop to consider whether doing it is any of their business in the first place, or whether they’re going about doing it in a way that disrespects the dignity or autonomy of their fellows. Legislators, bureaucrats, police, and other agents who enforce the state’s commands treat other people as pawns on a chessboard to be maneuvered into whatever configuration they deem best. Too many fail to see people as independent agents with their own desires and plans. That’s true even in relatively free societies.  What this screed fails to cover is _who_ keeps your neighbors out of your business? The rallying cry of ""the state is oppression!!"" is more important than explaining how things _should_ work.  From the libertarian party page:  > Libertarians oppose any government interference in your personal, family, and business decisions. We are here to fight the corruption in our systems, the corruption in our political classes, and remove the barriers they have created to societal, cultural and individual success  Okay.

mqtpyqj,"Knowingly polluting a river could cause others to become sick, which would violate the NAP. Looking through the lens of libertarianism, that would be against the tenets of the party.  As for _who_ should be keeping your neighbors out of your business, the answer is quite clear. There is a need for enforcement in every civilized country. Even in a home, you'll see this play out. A child steals money from their sibling to buy something they want. Who enforces the rules? A parental figure. But where an authoritarian figure may look to physical reprimands or yelling (is it any wonder why Republicans lean towards spanking as an acceptable punishment?), I think we'd both agree that a more open minded individual would take a less invasive and aggressive approach.  I apply the same mindset to 'the state.' Should we have facial recognition cameras on every corner? No.  Should we try to anticipate _who_ will commit a crime like Palantir seems to be aiming for? No.  Should we still entertain the death penalty? No.  There is a solid case for enforcement but it quickly gets out of hand and unconstitutional. Look at what is happening right now with deportations. Look at what has happened in the last with ICE, the DEA, and ATF. There is always overreach. Does that mean that they are entirely bad? No. But there is no enforcement for the enforcement, and that is dangerous for the liberty of all.

mqujffe,"***The Telegraph reports:***  Britain is secretly preparing for a direct military attack by Russia amid fears that it [is not ready for war](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/03/01/britain-ukraine-russia-war-zelensky-putin-trump-starmer/).  Officials have been asked to update 20-year-old contingency plans that would put the country on a war footing after [threats of attack](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/09/21/putin-ally-threatens-london-nuclear-strike-alarming-interview/) by the Kremlin.  A classified dossier will set out how the Government would respond to a declaration of war, including bunkers to protect the Cabinet and the Royal family, public service broadcasts and the stockpiling of resources.  Ministers fear that Britain would not only be outgunned by Russia and its allies on the battlefield but would also be [unprepared and poorly defended](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/03/12/young-men-unprepared-to-fight-for-britain-says-lord-hammond/) at home.  Kremlin officials have repeatedly threatened the UK with a direct attack over its support for Ukraine, which may soon include [British troops on the ground](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/04/10/british-troops-could-be-deployed-in-ukraine-for-five-years/).  Experts have warned that the country is vulnerable to an assault on its critical [national infrastructure](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/12/03/russia-exploiting-uk-dependence-technology-gchq-destruction/), including gas terminals, undersea cables, nuclear power plants and transport hubs.  The Telegraph understands that an update to the classified “homeland defence plan” will set out a strategy for the days immediately after a strike on the UK mainland by a hostile foreign state.  It will include scenarios in which Britain is hit by conventional missiles, [nuclear warheads](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/29/russia-test-nuclear-missiles-land-sea-air-massive-response/) or cyber operations, which were a limited threat when the last significant update to the plan was made before 2005.  The plan, by the Cabinet Office’s Resilience Directorate, will direct the Prime Minister and Cabinet on how to run a wartime government and when they should seek shelter in the Downing Street bunker or outside London.  The war strategies for the rail and road networks, courts, postal system and phone lines are all expected to be examined. It is unlikely that the document will be released to the public for decades, if at all.  The Cabinet Office has already modelled a scenario in which a hostile state launched missiles and cyber attacks on national infrastructure at the same time.  A risk assessment, published in January, found that a successful attack was “likely to result in civilian fatalities as well as members of the emergency services”, cause serious economic damage and disrupt essential services.  ***Read more:*** [***https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/05/05/starmer-prepares-for-attack-by-russia/***](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/05/05/starmer-prepares-for-attack-by-russia/)",1746516425.0,TheTelegraph,worldnews,t3_1kfyljz,t3_1kfyljz,1,/r/worldnews/comments/1kfyljz/starmer_prepares_britain_for_attack_by_russia/mqujffe/,0,0,0,0,0,0

The convention, which defines the rights and responsibilities of nations in their use of the world's oceans, came into force in 1994 and has been ratified by 168 countries and the European Union as of 2025.  The U.S. has recognized UNCLOS as a codification of customary international law but has not ratified it due to concerns over sovereignty and the potential for international lawsuits. Critics argue that joining UNCLOS would expose the U.S. to lawsuits, including those related to climate change, and would require the U.S. to pay royalties from oil and gas production on its extended continental shelf to an international body.  The United States is no longer the unchallenged global leader it once was, with its influence waning in various arenas such as conflict mediation and trust among traditional allies. The rise of challengers like China and the increasing autonomy of nations in the Global South has indicated the shift towards a multipolar world order where the U.S. is no longer the sole dominant power  This shift is evident in the diminishing ability of the US to project power and influence globally so the US must adapt to a multipolar world by trying to foster global relationships and developing processes and platforms to align interests and incentives to serve people.

mqug9el,"I’ve been studying war for over 25 years. I’d say the chances are higher, but it’s not going to look how it did in the first two wars. China will do everything in its ability to not cause significant disturbance in its economy, and frankly, too many countries rely on China and China knows it. Early Capitalist countries (America, England, Scandinavia, Canada etc) taught everyone for 70 years that you need to go where the money is. Now, China is where that money is and has been that way since the 90’s, but it began as early as the 70’s. China will likely do everything it can to prevent that production loss. Every major capitalist company on the entire planet either offloads their production or workforce to China or India because it’s the most profitable for the least amount of operational capital.   That being said, if India decides to dam or divert the Indus River it would all but destroy 80% or more of Pakistani food production. In the unlikely event that this happens, this war could absolutely lead to a nuclear war as Pakistani leadership, as well as the sheer number of extremist organizations they’ve harboured, is currently more likely to take drastic measures. Yes, even more than Trump or Putin. Regardless of how this hypothetical event plays out in reality, the war would likely spill into Russian, or Chinese territory.  How either nation would react to this is very, very challenging to predict. Time vs scale vs cost would be the primary logistical obstacles for a 3rd party nation to determine. By the time a “world war” scales up from this, the need for nukes would be drastically different than the decisions required would initially have suggested.   Nuclear war in Europe is extremely unlikely, and barring extreme ineptitude of intelligence, no western nation would launch a nuke unless the stakes were existential. If the various nations start destroying satellites, everything I said goes out the window. Mass paranoia would become the new king and that could absolutely lead to false flags.   Side note: who would even want to survive a nuclear war? Your best hope is to be nuked directly, because a global nuclear winter would cause a foot thick sheet of ice that blocked the entire planet for 1-10 years. Nothing would survive, and it would be a slow, cold, a dreadful end. There’s no hunting. No gathering. No food. Just cancer, disease, and death.   Anyway. I’d say it’s about 15%. The west relies heavily on U.S. intelligence. Since the U.S. has made enemies out of most nations, we’re about to enter a period where western intelligence is less reliable without the U.S., and that lack of reliable intel can lead to the aforementioned false flags.   Even if it was only a 1% chance, that still a very significant chance of it happening, which in itself is a horrifying concept.",1746514422.0,bongblaster420,worldnews,t3_1kfwqrh,t1_mqu8bh4,1,/r/worldnews/comments/1kfwqrh/many_in_us_and_western_europe_think_third_world/mqug9el/,0,0,0,0,0,0

As another example, it talks about degraded land fighting capabilities, and barely mentions the enormous challenges Russia is facing with heavy equipment manufacturing, and loss rate. It leaves out that Ukraine’s deteriorating position has been accelerated by the actions of the current administration. It talks about Russian missile capabilities while ignoring the fact that Russia’s effectively used up the entirety of its stockpile of long range missiles. It talks about heightened chance of nuclear war based on… vibes?   If this is the intel trump is getting on Russia, assuming he’s going off more than his own hubris-inspired beliefs, well then it’s no wonder he’s making these bone-headed moves.   The scariest thing about this report, frankly, is that it comes to the exact wrong conclusion about the war in Ukraine. It posits that protracted war with Ukraine increases risk to the US, which is precisely what Putin hopes we’ll believe. The truth is that if the west allows Russia to take large swathes of Ukraine, then the material wealth of the region and its population will allow Russia to rebuild its forces much more quickly, while simultaneously weakening NATO and giving Putin reason to believe he can do this all again.   Mark my words - the surest path to WWIII, in reality, is allowing Russia unimpeded access to pushing in Ukraine. That is almost guaranteed to result in a massive new war in 5-10 years’ time. Meanwhile, if we continue to help Ukraine fight off Russia, eventually the Russian economy and military will collapse as a statistical certainty. The EU understands this - the fact that the US doesn’t is as frustrating as it is lamentable.",1746514664.0,Heffe3737,worldnews,t3_1kfwqrh,t1_mqub7pf,1,/r/worldnews/comments/1kfwqrh/many_in_us_and_western_europe_think_third_world/mqugnxu/,0,0,0,0,0,0

We had over 500 atmospheric tests, and the whole US nuclear arsenal is ""just"" over 10 times that, so basically if there was no climate impact because of the testing, I doubt there would be such a catastrophic climate impact in case of war, at least not as bleak as stated in the article.    Radiation wise, famine and mass starvation due to disruption of agriculture and logistic chains, small and larger local conventional wars following the nuclear one... well that is a total different story, than the one depicted in your article, and the effects of it may be felt for centuries if not millenia afterwards. ",1746513850.0,sysmimas,worldnews,t3_1kfwqrh,t1_mquaf41,1,/r/worldnews/comments/1kfwqrh/many_in_us_and_western_europe_think_third_world/mqufbpi/,0,0,0,0,0,0

mqtxu2w,"You don't seem understand how the tax incentives actually work or what they do. We aren't just firing free money at production companies. It is tax credits that are mostly on labour costs, meaning they get a break (not fully) on how much tax they need to remit in payroll. But in order to get these credits, these companies are still spending their production budgets here which collectively is billions of dollars being injected into our local economies on an annual basis. The most recent numbers I could find on Statistics Canada was $10.4B in 2023. The tax credits just provide an incentivize and give productions a bang for their buck so to speak.    This employs thousands of Canadians with good, skilled, well paying jobs. Those wages are then subject to income tax (the production gets a break on their side of payroll remittance, but individuals are still taxed normally). Then that income is of course spent throughout the economy, which is also taxed at every transaction, and that spending contributes to the businesses on the receiving end, who then employ people, who are then taxed, etc...   But that's only the labour. The rest of the film production budget is still spent throughout countless ancillary businesses which support the film industry. For example like gear rentals, heavy equipment rentals, location rentals, film permits, food, custom fabrication, set dressing, building materials, paint, fuel, you name it! Of course plenty of these businesses operate outside of the film industry as well. But I wonder, do you think they enjoy the additional, often massive, windfalls in revenue from selling their goods and services to film productions? And do you think this contributes to more employment? Again those businesses get paid and pay corporate tax, their employees get paid and pay income tax, then they spend their money, etc... Also with every transaction for goods and services rendered from vendors have applicable sales tax as well.   It's an important industry, and worth going to bat for. You'd be surprised how much is filmed in Canada. It really is hard to quantify the net benefit that the tax credits provide, because the benefit is diffused throughout the economy, but there certainly is a large return on investment.   As for siphoning away American productions... Those are often projects that can't be filmed in various places in America due to available locations. Not everything can be filmed inside a studio. It depends on the production itself, the setting of the script and story. The willingness of specific locales to be friendly to disruptions that filming can cause. There can also be budgetary constraints. The lower Canadian dollar helps stretch budgets, lower costs in general too. Without Canada's film ""service"" industry, some films would simply not get made because the risk-to-reward isn't there if it costs xx% more to do it in LA or NY.",1746504742.0,catsaysmrau,worldnews,t3_1kftjkt,t1_mqtoz5w,11,/r/worldnews/comments/1kftjkt/ontario_will_suit_up_to_fight_against_possible/mqtxu2w/,0,0,0,0,0,0

mqt2oxh,"From the note:  BHP Group’s joint-venture partner Lundin Mining Corp declared that the companies’ Filo del Sol project in South America to be the largest discovery of copper in three decades, based on new drilling and analysis.  The undeveloped mine contains at least 13 million tons of the metal, as well as significant amounts of gold and silver, Lundin said in a statement on Sunday. Drilling is ongoing, and the deposit’s estimated size is increasing, it said.  Copper mines are getting harder and much more costly to develop, even as global demand for the metal is projected to increase given its role in the energy transition. That outlook has prompted a wave of mergers in the industry, as well as forecasts for persistent deficits — and higher prices — in the future.  The initial so-called mineral resource “has highlighted the potential for one of the highest grade undeveloped open-pit copper projects in the world, and one of the largest gold and silver resources globally,” Chief Executive Officer Jack Lundin said.   BHP acquired Filo Corp in a US$3-billion deal last year, in partnership with Lundin, to gain ownership of two copper projects known as Filo del Sol and Josemaría, which straddle the Argentina-Chile border.

mqtuz3a,"There are already a lot of comments so no idea if mine will obtain any traction.  But here are some thoughts which I hope are worthy:  * This comment is positioning by the US govt to the world, but in particular MAGA that while they ""might hope for the best"" in respect of negotiations with Canada they want to set low expectations just in case. * The Trump admin is again attempting to feed the flailing narrative that Canada has been feeding off America for decades.  Unless truly you are so stupid as to not have 2 functioning brain synapses you know this is a false narrative.   But Trump& Co have to try to push the narrative to support their negotiating stance. * Lutnick is smart enough to know that Canada is not a socialist country and never has been.  It is a liberal philosophy based society that has had past governance from center-left and center right parties - but never a socialist party - especially in the meaning of EU or Russian/Chinese type socialism.    There is a quasi-socialist national party which has never held power and at this time has only 7 of 343 seats (2%) in their national parliament.   Lutnick uttering this statement about socialists is pure disinformation and just on its own that he said such sets out his own lack of character. * Trump has made some statements about ""liking"" Carney and not concerned that the Conservative party in Canada lost the national election last week.  This is pure malarky.  Had the Conservatives won the tenor of negotiations and likely outcomes would likely have been far more favorable for America. * Instead they got the worst outcome possible:  the world's leading practical economist Mark Carney who is battle proven in financial contexts (only person to ever be Governor of 2 different central banks and both were in times of crisis) and is known to be a very tough, skilled negotiator.   And who is leaps and bounds more knowledgeable in every aspect of economics (Dr of Economics from Oxford) and finance then any Trump team member, and really all of the Trump team combined.  So Lutnicks statements are setting the stage for anticipated lack of results beyond platitudes and agreements to continue negotiating.    Carney has already set the stage in Canada for it to continue some degree of economic disentanglement from America.  He has stated he wishes to continue a relationship with America but the terms are forever changed from the historical friendly relationship of the last 80 yrs.    Carney is already talking to allies about forming new like minded groups and he has a lot of ears paying attention as he has high credibility and deep relationships around the globe.  Canada have very deep friendly relations with at least a hundred countries and they are starting to work them.  This is really concerning to America - Trumps threats and actions are having the opposite goal of what was envisioned.",1746503479.0,lifeisahighway2023,worldnews,t3_1kfr7ko,t3_1kfr7ko,6,/r/worldnews/comments/1kfr7ko/lutnick_skeptical_of_cutting_a_deal_with_canadas/mqtuz3a/,0,0,0,0,0,0
